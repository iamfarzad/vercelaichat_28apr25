## What to Expect

These workshops are built from real-world experience—not theory. Every session is designed to give your team a working understanding of AI and the ability to build practical tools by the end of the day.

Most AI tools fail in companies not because the technology is bad—but because the team doesn't understand how they work. These workshops start from the ground up:

* No prior coding or AI experience required
* Clear explanations of how prompts, tokens, context windows, and APIs actually function
* You’ll leave knowing how to troubleshoot basic AI issues on your own

If you don't understand the core terms, debugging an AI problem is a nightmare. This training removes that barrier.

### Workshop Format

* **3 hours theory:** What LLMs are, how they work, risks, limitations, and architecture basics.
* **3 hours hands-on:** Build a chatbot, automate a task, or create your own internal assistant using tools like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and LangChain.

### Tools Covered

* ChatGPT / OpenAI
* Claude / Anthropic
* Google Gemini
* Microsoft Copilot
* LangChain, Chroma, Supabase, Zapier

### Delivery Options

* On-site (Norway + Europe)
* Remote (Global)
* Includes templates, walkthroughs, sample prompts, and optional follow-up support
