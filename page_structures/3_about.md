## My Story

I started my AI journey in 2020 with no coding background. I wasted time and money on unreliable developers, broken products, and fake promises. That’s when I taught myself to build, debug, and deliver AI systems that actually work.

Since then, I’ve invested over 10,000 hours into building AI-powered systems for mental health, productivity, automation, and team tools. I’ve worked alone, failed fast, rebuilt better, and proven what works by doing it.

# My Full Story – Farzad Bayat

## I didn’t start in tech.

I spent over 15 years working in the creative industry—editing for NRK, MTV, National Geographic, and running content production across Europe and the Middle East. I built stories, led teams, managed clients, and produced for some of the biggest names in media. I was burned out. I was tired of creating video content that would be consumed in seconds, minutes, or hours depending on the format or client. So I set out to create something that would actually last.

## In 2020, I hit a wall—and rebuilt everything.

Burned out and frustrated with the limitations of content work, I wanted to build something lasting. But every time I tried to bring a technical idea to life, I ran into the same roadblock: developers who overpromised and underdelivered. So I stopped outsourcing. I taught myself how to build AI systems from scratch. No formal CS degree. No bootcamp. Just daily work, broken prototypes, and thousands of hours rebuilding what others failed to finish.

## What I’ve built, alone:

* **Optix.io** – A video production marketplace with predictive matching and content analysis
* **iWriter.ai** – An early GPT-powered writing assistant for SMEs in Norway
* **Talk to Eve** – An emotional AI assistant for burnout prevention with mindmap visualization, memory systems, and emotional state tracking
* **ZingZang Lab** – An AI music assistant for independent creators
* **farzadbayat.com** – This site, built as a working demo of everything I’ve learned

## I’m not a researcher. I’m not theoretical.

Everything I teach or deliver comes from hands-on experience:

* Building systems with Redis, ChromaDB, NetworkX, and LangChain
* Integrating LLMs like GPT, Claude, Gemini, and Copilot
* Failing fast, fixing it, and finding what actually works

## I now help others skip the pain.

I offer direct, practical help for teams and leaders who want to use AI—without drowning in buzzwords or vendor hype. If I can teach myself how to build production-ready AI tools, I can teach your team how to use them.
