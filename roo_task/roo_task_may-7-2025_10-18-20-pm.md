**Subtask 1: API Response Handling & Error Boundaries**

Context:

- The chat UI currently triggers errors like "Unexpected token '<'" due to the API returning HTML instead of JSON, indicating fetch layer or API error handling is broken.
- There is no error boundary or retry logic for failed message sends, and no user-facing error toasts or inline warnings.

Scope:

- Audit and fix the fetch logic in chat-related components to ensure only JSON is expected and handled. If the API returns non-JSON, show a user-friendly error.
- Add an error boundary around the chat logic (wrap ChatPanel or main chat UI).
- Implement retry logic for failed message sends.
- Add user-facing error feedback (toast or inline warning) for API failures.
- Only update chat-related components and error handling logic. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.

Instructions:

- Only perform the work outlined above. Do not deviate from this scope.
- When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
- These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.

**Subtask 2: Sidebar State, Metadata, and Logic Unification**

Context:

- The sidebar opens but content is blank or in an error state.
- Logic for loading model, history, or session context is not correctly connected.
- There is duplicate SidebarHistory logic in both the popover and sidebar component.
- There is poor separation of display logic vs control logic.

Scope:

- Audit and unify sidebar logic so that all state, metadata, and session context are loaded and rendered correctly.
- Remove any duplicated SidebarHistory logic between popover and sidebar components.
- Ensure sidebar content (history, model, session info) renders correctly and updates as expected.
- Refactor to separate display logic from control logic where possible, but do not over-engineer.
- Only update sidebar-related components and logic. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.

Instructions:

- Only perform the work outlined above. Do not deviate from this scope.
- When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
- These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.

**Subtask 3: Assistant Response Rendering and Streaming**

Context:

- User messages show, but no assistant reply appears.
- Either useChat response rendering is broken, or replies are not triggered due to API/fetch issues.
- Streaming/typing indicators may also be missing or broken.

Scope:

- Audit and fix useChat response rendering so that assistant replies always appear after user messages.
- Ensure streaming/typing indicators are shown while waiting for a reply.
- Verify that both user and assistant messages render in the chat history as expected.
- Only update chat-related components and message rendering logic. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.

Instructions:

- Only perform the work outlined above. Do not deviate from this scope.
- When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
- These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.

**Subtask 4: Prompt Suggestion Logic Fix**

Context:

- Prompt suggestions currently show up after the user submits a message, which is incorrect.
- Prompt suggestion logic should only trigger when the input is empty or on input focus.

Scope:

- Audit and fix the prompt suggestion logic so that suggestions only appear when the input is empty or focused, not after message submission.
- Ensure prompt suggestions do not interfere with normal chat flow.
- Only update prompt suggestion logic and related components. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.

Instructions:

- Only perform the work outlined above. Do not deviate from this scope.
- When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
- These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.

**Subtask 5: Theming and Dark Mode Consistency**

Context:

- The UI starts in dark mode, but the expected layout is light-themed.
- Theme context is not passed, or CSS vars are not respected.
- Hardcoded classNames are used instead of Tailwindâ€™s theme-aware utilities.

Scope:

- Unify theming using Tailwind theme tokens or a ThemeProvider.
- Ensure dark/light mode is applied consistently across all chat and popover components.
- Replace hardcoded classNames with theme-aware Tailwind utilities (e.g., `bg-card`, `text-foreground`).
- Only update theming and related logic. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.

**Subtask 6: Popover Hydration Flash and SSR Fixes**

Context:

- Popover causes a hydration flash when toggled.
- There is no `useHasMounted()` guard or `dynamic(() => ..., { ssr: false })` for Dialog rendering.
- No Suspense boundary wraps async context or messages.

Scope:

- Fix hydration flash in the popover/dialog by using `useHasMounted()` or `dynamic(() => ..., { ssr: false })` as appropriate.
- Add a Suspense boundary around async context or messages if needed.
- Only update SSR/hydration logic for the popover/dialog. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.

@/Roo_task_list.md this is what we have alredy done.

but now we have loads of issues that needs to be fixed.

COMPLETED (From Roo_task_list.md)

You followed the original triage plan and implemented:
 1. Chat code extracted into ChatPanel
 2. Popover setup with Radix Dialog (ChatPopover)
 3. Theme variables used (bg-card, text-foreground, etc.)
 4. Sidebar toggle working
 5. Session persistence using useChat({ persistKey })
 6. SSR fixes applied (no direct window access, dynamic imports, use client)
 7. Build setup validated with pnpm lint/test/dev

This was all greenlit as done in the task list, and the commit history probably reflects that.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The task is to enhance the sidebar with chat search, filters/tags, pin/unpin, and multi-session UI, while ensuring logic separation and deduplication. The main candidate file is [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1), likely containing sidebar logic and display. There may be related logic in other sidebar or chat session components, but the sidebar-history file is the primary target.

First, I need to review the contents of [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1) to:

- Assess current sidebar logic and UI.
- Identify how chat sessions are managed and displayed.
- Check for any existing search, filter, pin, or multi-session logic.
- Look for any logic/display coupling or duplication.

This will inform the minimal, modular changes needed to add the required features and ensure clean separation.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The sidebar logic is all in [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1). There is no search, filter, pin, or multi-session UI yet. The chat list is rendered directly from the fetched data, and there is no deduplication or separation of display/control logic.

To proceed:

- Add local state for search, filters/tags, and pinning.
- Add UI controls for search input, filter/tag selection, and pin/unpin buttons.
- Add multi-session UI (e.g., "New Session" button, session switcher).
- Deduplicate sidebar logic by extracting chat filtering/search/pin logic into pure functions within the file.
- Keep display and control logic separated (e.g., use hooks/state for control, pure render for display).

First, I will check if there is a reusable button or tag component in `components/ui/` for filters/tags and pin/unpin, to avoid duplication.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
There are reusable UI components available: [`button.tsx`](components/ui/button.tsx:1), [`input.tsx`](components/ui/input.tsx:1), [`select.tsx`](components/ui/select.tsx:1), [`tabs.tsx`](components/ui/tabs.tsx:1), and [`dropdown-menu.tsx`](components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx:1). These can be used for search, filters/tags, pin/unpin, and session switching.

Plan:

- Add local state for search, filters, pinned chats, and sessions.
- Use `<Input />` for search, `<Select />` or `<Tabs />` for filters/tags, and `<Button />` for pin/unpin and session actions.
- Extract filtering/search/pin logic into pure functions.
- Add a "New Session" button and a session switcher UI.
- Ensure deduplication and separation of display/control logic.

Next, I will check if there is any existing session management logic or types in the codebase (e.g., in `lib/`, `hooks/`, or `components/`). This will help avoid duplication and ensure multi-session UI is consistent with the rest of the app.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The only session-related logic found is for authentication (`Session` from `next-auth`), not chat sessions. No multi-session chat logic exists yet, so I will implement it locally in the sidebar for now.

Plan for [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1):

- Add state for search, filters, pinned chat IDs, and sessions (array of session objects, each with its own chat list).
- Add UI: search input (`Input`), filter/tags (`Select` or `Tabs`), pin/unpin button (`Button`), session switcher (`Tabs` or `Select`), and "New Session" button.
- Extract filtering/search/pin logic into pure functions.
- Ensure deduplication and separation of display/control logic.

Next, I will read [`components/ui/input.tsx`](components/ui/input.tsx:1) and [`components/ui/button.tsx`](components/ui/button.tsx:1) to confirm their API for use in the sidebar.

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.

[`Input`](components/ui/input.tsx:5) is a styled wrapper for `<input>`, accepts all standard props, and is suitable for search. Next, I will check [`components/ui/button.tsx`](components/ui/button.tsx:1) to confirm its API for pin/unpin, session, and filter/tag actions.

- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</custom_instructions>

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The previous step was to check the API for the Button component, which is now confirmed: it supports variants, sizes, and all standard button props, making it suitable for pin/unpin, session, and filter/tag actions.

There is also a [`components/sidebar-history-item.tsx`](components/sidebar-history-item.tsx:1) file, which may already encapsulate chat row display logic. If so, pin/unpin and deduplication logic should be handled there for separation of concerns.

Next, I will read [`components/sidebar-history-item.tsx`](components/sidebar-history-item.tsx:1) to check if it is used for rendering chat items and if it can be extended for pin/unpin and tag/filter UI, ensuring DRY and separation of display/control logic.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
[`components/sidebar-history-item.tsx`](components/sidebar-history-item.tsx:1) encapsulates chat row display logic, using a memoized `ChatItem` component. It already supports actions via a dropdown, so adding pin/unpin and tags/filters here is clean and DRY. The sidebar can manage pin/filter/search/session state and pass props to `ChatItem`.

Plan:

- Add state for search, filters, pinned chat IDs, and sessions in [`sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1).
- Add UI for search (`Input`), filters/tags (`Select`/`Tabs`), pin/unpin (button in dropdown), and session management (tabs/select + "New Session").
- Extract filtering/search/pin logic into pure functions.
- Pass pin/unpin handler and pin state to `ChatItem`.
- Ensure deduplication and separation of display/control logic.

Next, I will update [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1) to implement these enhancements.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The task is not yet complete. The last step was to update [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1) to add chat search, filters/tags, pin/unpin, multi-session UI, and deduplication/separation of logic. The supporting components and UI primitives are available, and `sidebar-history-item.tsx` can be extended for pin/unpin.

I will now proceed to update [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1) to:

- Add state for search, filters, pinned chats, and sessions.
- Add UI for search, filters/tags, pin/unpin, and session management.
- Extract filtering/search/pin logic into pure functions.
- Use/extend `ChatItem` for each chat row, passing pin/unpin handlers and pin state.

This will be a single, focused update.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Sidebar enhancements are complete. The sidebar now supports chat search, tag/filter selection, pin/unpin functionality, and a multi-session UI with session switching and creation. Chat list logic is deduplicated and separated from display, with pure functions handling filtering, searching, pin sorting, and deduplication. Pin/unpin and session state are managed locally, and the UI uses existing reusable components. The chat row rendering is delegated to the `ChatItem` component for clean separation of concerns.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The error "onClear is not defined" suggests a missing handler, likely for the search/filter UI in the sidebar. This handler is commonly used to clear a search input, but in the recent sidebar update, no `onClear` prop or function was defined or passed to the `Input` component.

I need to check the usage of `onClear` in [`components/sidebar-history.tsx`](components/sidebar-history.tsx:1) and possibly in [`components/ui/input.tsx`](components/ui/input.tsx:1) to see if the Input expects this prop. If so, I should add a handler and pass it down, or remove the prop if not needed.

First, I will search for `onClear` in the sidebar and input components.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

**Assistant:**

<thinking>
The only `onClear` usage is in [`components/chat-header.tsx`](components/chat-header.tsx:1), not in the sidebar or input components. The error is likely from a missing or undefined `onClear` prop when rendering `chat-header.tsx`. This is unrelated to the sidebar enhancements, but may be triggered if the sidebar or chat panel tries to render a header without providing `onClear`.

I need to check how `chat-header.tsx` is used and if the parent component is missing the `onClear` prop. I will search for where `chat-header.tsx` is imported and used, to identify the missing handler.

- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format

### Frontend Example

```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example

```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices

- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** â€“ Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** â€“ Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** â€“ TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions

- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineeringâ€”favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` â€“ Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` â€“ Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` â€“ Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` â€“ Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` â€“ Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` â€“ Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` â€“ Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` â€“ Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints

- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) â€“ ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides â€“ backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration â€“ e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.
