## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

**Assistant:**

Our goal is to build and maintain a modular, full-stack web application using Next.js 14 (App Router, React, Tailwind CSS) for the frontend and Node.js/Express (TypeScript) for the backend. The project should follow best practices: clear separation of concerns, DRY principles, type safety, and robust testing (Jest, React Testing Library). All code must be simple, maintainable, and accessible, with shared types between front and back, and a focus on clean API design and integration.

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Our goal is to develop and maintain a modular, full-stack web application using Next.js 14 (App Router, React, Tailwind CSS) for the frontend and Node.js/Express (TypeScript) for the backend. The project must follow best practices: clear separation of concerns, DRY principles, type safety, robust testing (Jest, React Testing Library), and accessibility. All code should be simple, maintainable, and accessible, with shared types between frontend and backend, and a focus on clean API design and integration.

  1 | ## This was the prompt
  2 | 
  3 | Below is a direct “triage → fix” checklist for the repo iamfarzad / vercelaichat_28apr25.
  4 | Running through it one item at a time will get the pop‑over version working and remove the current visual / component errors.
  5 | 
  6 | ⸻
  7 | 
  8 | 1 — Compile & import errors
  9 | 
 10 | Symptom Why it happens Quick fix
 11 | “Failed to fetch @/components/…” in online runners The @ alias only exists in your Vite / Next config. CDN sandboxes treat it as a URL. Use relative imports in isolated demos. Locally keep @—just be sure next.config.js has:compiler: { emotion: true },<br>webpack(cfg){ cfg.resolve.alias['@']=path.resolve(__dirname,'./');return cfg }
 12 | Radix Dialog / framer‑motion mismatch warnings You mounted Radix in a Server Component but use client‑only libs inside Add 'use client' at the top of every file that contains Dialog, framer‑motion, or useChat.
 13 | Hydration mismatch (popover opens but UI flashes) React mounts the chat twice: once SSR, again CSR; IDs differ In ChatPopover.tsx wrap the <Dialog.Root> with dynamic(()=>import('./ChatPopoverInner'),{ssr:false}) or gate the render with useHasMounted() hook.
 14 | 
 15 | ⸻
 16 | 
 17 | 2 — Move the original chat into a pop‑over without duplicating code
 18 |  1. Extract the existing page root (the one that renders <MultimodalInput … />, <SuggestedActions />, the message list, etc.) into a pure client component:
 19 | 
 20 | // components/ChatPanel.tsx
 21 | 'use client';
 22 | import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';
 23 | import ChatPage from '@/app/chat/_components/ChatPage'; // whatever your current JS is
 24 | 
 25 | export default function ChatPanel({ onClose }: { onClose: () => void }) {
 26 |   const chat = useChat({ id: 'main', persistKey: 'chat-main' });
 27 |   return <ChatPage chat={chat} onClose={onClose} />;
 28 | }
 29 | 
 30 |  2. Wrap it in a Radix pop‑over/dialog:
 31 | 
 32 | // components/ChatPopover.tsx
 33 | 'use client';
 34 | import * as Dialog from '@radix-ui/react-dialog';
 35 | import ChatPanel from './ChatPanel';
 36 | 
 37 | export default function ChatPopover() {
 38 |   return (
 39 |     <Dialog.Root>
 40 |       <Dialog.Trigger asChild>
 41 |         <button className="fixed bottom-4 right-4 btn-brick-primary z-50">
 42 |           Let’s chat
 43 |         </button>
 44 |       </Dialog.Trigger>
 45 | 
 46 |       <Dialog.Portal>
 47 |         <Dialog.Overlay className="fixed inset-0 bg-black/40 backdrop-blur-sm" />
 48 |         <Dialog.Content
 49 |           className="fixed inset-0 m-auto h-[90vh] w-[90vw] rounded-xl
 50 |                      border border-border bg-popover text-popover-foreground shadow-xl"
 51 |         >
 52 |           <ChatPanel onClose={() => Dialog.close()} />
 53 |         </Dialog.Content>
 54 |       </Dialog.Portal>
 55 |     </Dialog.Root>
 56 |   );
 57 | }
 58 | 
 59 |  3. Put <ChatPopover /> on your new home page (/app/page.tsx).
 60 | 
 61 | ⸻
 62 | 
 63 | 3 — Colour / theme mismatches
 64 |  • globals.css already defines --background, --popover, --border, etc.
 65 | Replace every literal colour in chat components with the corresponding utility:
 66 | 
 67 | - className="bg-white text-black"
 68 | 
 69 | + className="bg-card text-card-foreground"
 70 | 
 71 |  • For shadcn/ui buttons add:
 72 | 
 73 | className={cn(buttonVariants({ variant: 'secondary' }), 'bg-brand-orange')}
 74 | 
 75 |  • Tailwind utilities you created:
 76 |  • bg-background → var(–background)
 77 |  • text-foreground → var(–foreground)
 78 |  • border-border   → var(–border)
 79 | Use them consistently; the pop‑over inherits the right palette.
 80 | 
 81 | ⸻
 82 | 
 83 | 4 — Sidebar show / hide toggle
 84 | 
 85 | Inside ChatPage keep:
 86 | 
 87 | const [showSidebar, setShowSidebar] = useState(true);
 88 | 
 89 | and gate the markup:
 90 | 
 91 | {showSidebar && <Sidebar … />}
 92 | <button onClick={()=>setShowSidebar(!showSidebar)}>…</button>
 93 | 
 94 | The state lives inside ChatPanel, so it survives closing the dialog as long as ChatPanel itself isn’t unmounted. If you want it to survive that too, hoist the boolean into a React context placed in /app/layout.tsx.
 95 | 
 96 | ⸻
 97 | 
 98 | 5 — Persist session between openings
 99 | 
100 | useChat({ id:'main', persistKey:'chat-main' }) already stores messages in localStorage.
101 | If you prefer “in‑memory while session is open”:
102 | 
103 | const [chatState,setChatState]=useState<ChatState|null>(null);
104 | <ChatPopover chatState={chatState} setChatState={setChatState}/>
105 | 
106 | Pass both down to useChat.
107 | 
108 | ⸻
109 | 
110 | 6 — Typical build blockers in this repo
111 | 
112 | Error Fix
113 | ReferenceError: document is not defined during build Move any window / document access into useEffect(() => { ... }, [])
114 | fast-deep-equal import SSR crash Add import equal from 'fast-deep-equal'; only in client files or wrap with dynamic(() => import('fast-deep-equal'), { ssr:false }).
115 | ESLint complains about server components importing client hooks Add /*@ts-expect-error server-component*/ or refactor so hooks live only in 'use client' files.
116 | 
117 | ⸻
118 | 
119 | 7 — Run check list
120 | 
121 | pnpm install
122 | pnpm lint      # should pass
123 | pnpm test      # jest / playwright
124 | pnpm dev       # local preview
125 | 
126 | If style still looks off, open DevTools → Elements → Computed Styles and confirm CSS variables are resolving to the expected oklch values.
127 | 
128 | ⸻
129 | 
130 | Bottom line
131 |  • Do not duplicate the chat code—extract it into one ChatPanel.
132 |  • Mount that panel inside a Radix dialog that covers 90 % × 90 % of the viewport.
133 |  • Rely on your CSS‐variable utilities (bg‑background, text‑foreground, etc.) instead of literal colours.
134 |  • Keep useChat with persistKey to remember the conversation.
135 | 
136 | Follow the checklist above and the remaining UI/UX mismatches should disappear. Ping me with any specific error message that persists and I’ll zero in on it.
137 | 
138 | this is what has been done
139 | 
140 | 
141 | subtask 7 of the triage/fix plan from [`components/Roo_task_list.md`](components/Roo_task_list.md:1): **Final QA & Checklist**.
142 | 
143 | **Context:**
144 | - All previous subtasks (1–6) are complete: chat logic is centralized, popover is integrated, color/theme consistency is ensured, sidebar toggle is implemented, session persistence is enabled, and SSR/build blockers are resolved.
145 | 
146 | **Scope:**
147 | - Run `pnpm install`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, and `pnpm dev`.
148 | - Check for any remaining style or hydration issues.
149 | - Use DevTools to confirm CSS variables are applied as expected.
150 | - Only perform the work outlined above. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
151 | 
152 | **Instructions:**
153 | - Only perform the work outlined above. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
154 | - When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/checked and any issues found.
155 | - These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.
156 | 
157 | ##
158 | 
159 | Begin with subtask 1 of the triage/fix plan: **Resolve Compile & Import Errors**.
160 | 
161 | **Scope:**
162 | 
163 | - Audit all imports in chat-related components for `@/` alias usage. Replace with relative imports or ensure the alias is configured in [`next.config.js`](next.config.js:1).
164 | - Add `'use client'` to the top of every file that uses Radix Dialog, framer-motion, or `useChat`.
165 | - For hydration mismatch (popover opens but UI flashes), wrap `` in `dynamic(()=>import(...),{ssr:false})` or use a `useHasMounted()` hook as appropriate.
166 | - Only perform the work outlined above. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
167 | - When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
168 | 
169 | **Instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.**
170 | 
171 | Begin with subtask 2 of the triage/fix plan: **Extract and Refactor Chat into Popover**
172 | 
173 | **Scope:**
174 | 
175 | - Extract the existing chat logic/UI (the part rendering ``,``, message list, etc.) into a pure client component named `ChatPanel` in `components/ChatPanel.tsx`.
176 | - Mount `ChatPanel` inside a Radix Dialog in `components/ChatPopover.tsx` as described in the checklist.
177 | - Place `` on the homepage (`app/page.tsx` or equivalent).
178 | - Do not duplicate chat code—ensure only one source of chat logic.
179 | - Only perform the work outlined above. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
180 | - When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
181 | 
182 | **Instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.**
183 | 
184 | Begin with subtask 3 of the triage/fix plan: **Color/Theme Consistency**
185 | 
186 | **Scope:**
187 | 
188 | - Replace all literal color classes (e.g., `bg-white`, `text-black`) in chat-related components with Tailwind utility classes that use CSS variables (e.g., `bg-card`, `text-card-foreground`, `bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`).
189 | - For shadcn/ui buttons, ensure `buttonVariants` and custom classes (e.g., `'bg-brand-orange'`) are used as described in the checklist.
190 | - Only update chat-related components and UI elements involved in the popover/chat flow. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
191 | - When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
192 | 
193 | **Instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.**
194 | 
195 | Begin with subtask 4 of the triage/fix plan: **Sidebar Show/Hide Toggle**
196 | 
197 | **Scope:**
198 | 
199 | - In `ChatPanel` (or the main chat UI component), add a `showSidebar` state and a button to toggle sidebar visibility.
200 | - Gate sidebar rendering with `{showSidebar && }` and provide a button to toggle it.
201 | - If persistence across dialog openings is desired, hoist the sidebar state into a React context in `app/layout.tsx`.
202 | - Only update chat-related components and sidebar logic. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
203 | - When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
204 | 
205 | **Instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.**
206 | 
207 | Begin with subtask 5 of the triage/fix plan: **Persist Session Between Openings**
208 | 
209 | **Scope:**
210 | 
211 | - Ensure chat state is persisted between dialog openings using `useChat({ id: 'main', persistKey: 'chat-main' })` for localStorage-based persistence.
212 | - If in-memory session persistence is preferred, lift chat state up and pass it as props to `ChatPopover` and `ChatPanel`.
213 | - Only update chat-related components and session logic. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
214 | - When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.
215 | 
216 | **Instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions for code mode.**
217 | 
218 | Begin with subtask 6 of the triage/fix plan: **SSR/Build Blockers**
219 | 
220 | **Scope:**
221 | 
222 | - Move any `window` or `document` access in chat-related components into `useEffect(() => { ... }, [])` to avoid SSR errors.
223 | - Ensure `fast-deep-equal` is only imported in client files or wrapped with `dynamic(() => import('fast-deep-equal'), { ssr: false })` if needed.
224 | - Address any ESLint errors about server components importing client hooks by adding `/* @ts-expect-error server-component */` or refactoring so hooks live only in `'use client'` files.
225 | - Only update chat-related components and SSR/build logic. Do not refactor unrelated code or proceed to other checklist items.
226 | - When finished, use the `attempt_completion` tool to provide a concise summary of what was fixed/changed.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

{
  "chat_id": "df4b323a-0cee-4070-afb5-f98433b741ca",
  "response": "<think>\nOkay, let me tackle this query step by step. The user wants a comparison between the current project (iamfarzad/vercelaichat_28apr25) and the original Vercel AI Chatbot repo. They specified five areas to focus on, so I need to go through each one systematically.\n\nFirst, I'll look at chat logic and component structure. From the search results, the original Vercel AI Chatbot uses components like ChatPanel and ChatPopover, which are part of their structured approach. The current project, as per the code snippets in [2] and [4], has components named Chat, ChatInput, and Button. This suggests a simpler structure without the more complex UI elements like popovers. The original might have more dynamic features, while the current project is more streamlined.\n\nNext, color and theme usage. The original repo uses Tailwind with CSS variables for theming, which allows for easy customization. The current project's code in [2] doesn't mention Tailwind or CSS variables explicitly, but it uses a Button component with inline styles. This might mean less flexibility in theming compared to the original, which could be a regression.\n\nFor sidebar toggle and session persistence, the original has a collapsible sidebar with session storage. The current project's search results [5] mention a context panel that displays retrieved content segments. There's a useEffect hook in [5] that fetches context when messages update, which might relate to session persistence. However, there's no explicit mention of a sidebar toggle, so maybe this feature is missing or implemented differently.\n\nRegarding SSR/build blockers, the original uses Next.js with server-side rendering and has specific configurations to avoid issues. The current project's code in [2] and [5] includes client-side effects and async operations, which could pose SSR challenges. For example, the useEffect hook in [5] might cause hydration mismatches if not handled properly, potentially leading to build blockers.\n\nImport aliasing and client/server boundaries: The original uses Next.js' default aliases and strict server-client separation. The current project's code in [2] uses '@/components' import aliases, which is standard. However, the context retrieval in [5] mixes client-side fetch calls with server-side API routes, which might blur the boundaries if not properly managed, possibly leading to inefficiencies.\n\nSummarizing the key differences, the current project simplifies the component structure and adds a context panel for RAG, which is an improvement. However, it might lack some UI features like the sidebar toggle and advanced theming. There could be potential SSR issues due to client-side hooks, and the theming is less flexible. No major regressions are mentioned, but some features from the original might be missing.\n</think>\n\nThe iamfarzad/vercelaichat_28apr25 project shows several key differences from Vercel's original AI Chatbot template:\n\n## 1. Chat Logic & Component Structure  \n**Simplified architecture** replaces `ChatPanel`/`ChatPopover` with three core components:  \n- `Chat` (message rendering)  \n- `ChatInput` (textarea + submission button)  \n- `Button` (basic form trigger) [2]  \n\n**Missing features**:  \n- No dynamic message toolbar or popover controls  \n- Limited error handling compared to Vercel's error boundary system  \n\n## 2. Color/Theme Implementation  \n**Regression**:  \n- Hardcoded icon colors (`FaArrowCircleRight`) vs. Vercel's CSS variable-driven theming  \n- No Tailwind theming layer - uses direct className assignments [2]  \n- Missing dark/light mode toggle  \n\n**Improvement**:  \n- Simplified styling approach for faster iteration  \n\n## 3. Sidebar & Session Management  \n**Key differences**:  \n- No sidebar implementation in current codebase vs Vercel's collapsible `ChatList`  \n- Session persistence handled through basic `useEffect` vs Vercel's localStorage integration [5]  \n- Context panel added for RAG visualization (highlighting retrieved content segments) [5]  \n\n## 4. SSR/Build Considerations  \n**Potential blockers**:  \n- Client-side `useState`/`useEffect` in core chat flow vs Vercel's server-centric stream hydration  \n- Missing `experimental-edge` runtime flags for AI routes  \n- No Suspense boundaries for streaming content  \n\n## 5. Code Structure  \n**Notable changes**:  \n- Import aliases use `@/components` vs Vercel's relative paths  \n- Server/client boundaries blurred in context retrieval:  \n  ```jsx\n  useEffect(() => { \n    const response = await fetch(\"/api/context\") // Mixed client/server logic [5]\n  })\n  ```  \n- No Zod validation layer for API responses  \n\n**Improvements**:  \n- Added RAG context visualization through separate API endpoint [5]  \n- Simplified message handling pipeline  \n\nThis fork prioritizes simplicity and RAG integration over Vercel's robust error handling and theming system, while introducing potential hydration risks from client-side async operations. The tradeoff enables faster context-aware responses but reduces customization capabilities."

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Comparison of iamfarzad/vercelaichat_28apr25 with the original Vercel AI Chatbot:

**1. Chat Logic & Component Structure:**  
- Current project uses simplified components (`Chat`, `ChatInput`, `Button`) instead of Vercel's `ChatPanel`/`ChatPopover` and lacks dynamic popover controls and advanced error boundaries.
- No code duplication, but some UI features (like popover and toolbar) are missing.

**2. Color/Theme Implementation:**  
- Theming is less flexible: hardcoded colors and direct classNames are used instead of Tailwind CSS variables and utilities.
- No dark/light mode toggle; original repo supports full theming.

**3. Sidebar & Session Management:**  
- No sidebar toggle; session persistence is basic (`useEffect`), while Vercel uses localStorage and a collapsible sidebar.
- Current project adds a context panel for RAG, which is an improvement.

**4. SSR/Build Considerations:**  
- Client-side hooks (`useEffect`, `useState`) in main chat flow may cause SSR/hydration issues.
- No Suspense boundaries or edge runtime flags as in the original.

**5. Code Structure:**  
- Uses `@/components` alias; original uses relative paths.
- Some client/server boundaries are blurred (e.g., client fetches to `/api/context`).
- No Zod validation for API responses.

**Summary:**  
This fork prioritizes simplicity and RAG context visualization over advanced theming, error handling, and UI features found in the original. It introduces potential SSR/hydration risks and reduces customization, but enables faster context-aware responses.

i think you got it backwords. 

the vercel chat ai uses the https://github.com/vercel/ai-chatbot 
uses the app/(chat)

i have customized it to use the @askbar as a entry to the 'components/chat-popover.tsx' (see below for file content) from the 'components/hero-section' (see below for file content) 

is this not clear

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Your customization diverges from the original Vercel AI Chatbot (`app/(chat)`) by introducing a new entry point: the `@askbar` in `components/hero-section/ask-bar.tsx`, which triggers the chat popover (`components/chat-popover.tsx`). This popover is not part of the default Vercel repo, which uses a dedicated chat route/page. Instead, your version allows chat to be launched contextually from the hero section, providing a more integrated and flexible UX.

Key differences:
- **Entry Point:** Chat is launched via the AskBar in the hero section, not a standalone `/chat` route.
- **Popover Architecture:** Chat UI is rendered in a modal popover (`ChatPopover`), not a full page.
- **Sidebar & State:** The popover includes sidebar logic and session handling, matching or extending Vercel's sidebar features.
- **Integration:** The hero section (`HeroSection`) and AskBar are tightly coupled to the chat popover, enabling contextual chat from the landing page.

This approach is clear and distinct from the original repo, prioritizing seamless, in-place chat access over a separate chat page.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Your `components/chat-popover.tsx` and `components/ChatPanel.tsx` are missing several advanced features from the original Vercel AI Chatbot:

- **Missing Features:**
  - No message actions toolbar (edit, copy, delete, etc.).
  - No system prompt or model selector UI.
  - No streaming message typing indicator or animated loading dots.
  - No error boundary or retry logic for failed messages.
  - No markdown/attachment preview enhancements.
  - No advanced visibility controls (public/private toggle, share link).
  - No chat export, rename, or delete functionality.
  - No multi-user or multi-session management UI.
  - No advanced sidebar features (search, filter, pin, etc.).
  - No Suspense boundaries for streaming or SSR optimizations.

- **Summary:**  
  Your implementation covers the core chat flow and sidebar basics, but lacks the rich UI/UX, error handling, and advanced controls present in the original. To reach feature parity, consider incrementally adding these missing elements.

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

**Assistant:**

<attempt_completion>
<result>
Confirmed: `components/chat-popover.tsx` duplicates sidebar logic already present in `ChatPanel`. Both `ChatContent` (inside the popover) and `ChatPanel` manage sidebar state and render a sidebar/history panel (`SidebarHistory`). This results in two separate sidebar implementations—one controlled by the popover's context and another by the chat panel's local state. This duplication can cause inconsistent sidebar behavior, redundant UI, and unnecessary complexity. Refactoring to centralize sidebar state and rendering in a single place is recommended for maintainability and UX consistency.

  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</custom_instructions>

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</custom_instructions>

Compared to the original Vercel AI Chatbot UI, your implementation has the following differences:

- **Buttons & Input:**  
  - The multimodal input supports attachments, send, and stop actions, but lacks advanced controls like model selector, system prompt, and markdown formatting buttons.
  - The send/stop/attach buttons are present but visually simpler and less feature-rich than the original.

- **Sidebar:**  
  - Sidebar exists but is less interactive: missing features like chat search, pinning, renaming, or deleting conversations.
  - No chat export or multi-session management UI.

- **Action Buttons:**  
  - Message-level actions (edit, copy, delete, retry) are missing.
  - No visibility toggle (public/private), share link, or markdown preview enhancements.

- **General UI/UX:**  
  - The layout is clean and functional, but lacks the original's advanced controls, toolbars, and contextual actions.
  - Some animation and feedback elements (e.g., streaming indicators, animated loading dots) are missing or simplified.

To reach feature parity, consider adding model/system controls, message actions, sidebar enhancements, and richer feedback/animation.

we need to move al the oreginal chat components to our chat panel 
samething just in the 'components/chat-popover.tsx' (see below for file content) 'components/ChatPanel.tsx' (see below for file content) 

is this not clear that all of these things are missing ?

<role>You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

<result>
It is clear that your current `ChatPanel` and related components are missing many original Vercel AI Chatbot features: model selector, system prompt, message action buttons, markdown formatting, advanced sidebar controls, chat export, and more. To achieve feature parity, you need to migrate all original chat UI components and controls into your `ChatPanel`, ensuring all buttons, sidebar actions, and input enhancements are present and functional within your popover-based layout.

Mode-specific Instructions:
1. Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.

2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.

3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.

4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.

5. Once the user confirms the plan, ask them if they'd like you to write it to a markdown file.

6. Use the switch_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.</custom_instructions>

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.

Mode-specific Instructions:
1. Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.

2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.

3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.

4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.

5. Once the user confirms the plan, ask them if they'd like you to write it to a markdown file.

6. Use the switch_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.</custom_instructions>

**Assistant:**

Here’s a **detailed plan** to migrate all original Vercel AI Chatbot features into your `ChatPanel`/popover architecture, ensure no duplication, and unify dark/light mode support:

---

## 1. **Audit & Inventory**
- **List all original chat UI components** from the Vercel repo (e.g. model selector, system prompt, message actions, markdown toolbar, sidebar controls, etc.).
- **Compare** with your current `ChatPanel`, `chat-popover.tsx`, and sidebar to identify missing features and any duplicate logic.

---

## 2. **Migration & Refactor Plan**

### a. **Component Migration**
- **Move all original chat UI components** (model selector, system prompt, markdown/formatting toolbar, message actions, export/share, etc.) into your `ChatPanel`.
- **Sidebar:** Ensure all sidebar features (search, pin, rename, delete, multi-session, etc.) are present and only implemented once.
- **Popover:** The popover should only wrap `ChatPanel` and not contain any chat logic or sidebar duplication.

### b. **Deduplication**
- **Remove any duplicate sidebar, header, or input logic** from the popover or other wrappers.
- **Centralize all chat logic/UI** in `ChatPanel` and its direct children.

### c. **Dark/Light Mode Unification**
- **Ensure all components use the same theme context/provider** (likely via a `ThemeProvider` at the app root).
- **Test dark/light mode switching** in both the popover and sidebar; fix any isolated theme logic.

---

## 3. **Implementation Steps**

    E --> F[Unify Theme Handling]
    F --> G[Test All Flows & Modes]
    G --> H[Cleanup & Document]
```

---

## 4. **Testing & QA**
- **Test all chat features** (model selection, message actions, sidebar controls, markdown, etc.) in the popover.
- **Test dark/light mode** in all chat and sidebar states.
- **Check for any remaining duplicate code** or UI inconsistencies.

---

## 5. **Documentation & Cleanup**
- **Document** the new structure and any removed/merged files.
- **Remove dead code** and update references/imports.

---

## 6. **Success Criteria**
- All original Vercel chat features are present in the popover/ChatPanel.
- No duplicate sidebar, header, or input logic.
- Dark/light mode works everywhere.
- Code is DRY, modular, and easy to maintain.

---

**Questions for you:**
1. Do you want to preserve any customizations you’ve made, or should we strictly match the original Vercel UI/UX?
2. Should we migrate all sidebar features, or only a subset?
3. Is there a specific order of features you want prioritized (e.g., sidebar first, then message actions, etc.)?

Would you like any changes to this plan, or is it ready for implementation?

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

Understood. Here is the clarified plan:

**Goal:**  
Move ALL original Vercel AI Chatbot chat UI components and features into your `ChatPanel` and popover architecture, preserving your custom popover and panel structure, and ensuring no duplicates remain. All features (model selector, system prompt, markdown toolbar, message actions, sidebar controls, export/share, etc.) must be present and functional inside the popover/ChatPanel.  
Dark/light mode must work seamlessly across the popover, ChatPanel, and sidebar, using your global.css and Tailwind setup.

**Plan:**  
1. Inventory all original Vercel chat UI components and features.
2. Migrate each feature/component into your `ChatPanel` (and sidebar if needed).
3. Remove any duplicate or obsolete chat/sidebar logic from wrappers or other files.
4. Ensure all theming uses your global.css/Tailwind and works in all chat UI states.
5. Test for feature parity, no duplication, and consistent theming.

Ready for implementation once you confirm.

USER'S CUSTOM INSTRUCTIONS

The following additional instructions are provided by the user, and should be followed to the best of your ability without interfering with the TOOL USE guidelines.

Language Preference:
You should always speak and think in the "English" (en) language unless the user gives you instructions below to do otherwise.

Global Instructions:
You are Roo, a highly skilled software engineer with extensive knowledge in many programming languages, frameworks, design patterns, and best practices.




## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.

Mode-specific Instructions:
1. Do some information gathering (for example using read_file or search_files) to get more context about the task.

2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.

3. Once you've gained more context about the user's request, you should create a detailed plan for how to accomplish the task. Include Mermaid diagrams if they help make your plan clearer.

  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.

Mode-specific Instructions:
Your role is to coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes. As an orchestrator, you should:

1. When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes.

2. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:
    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.
    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.
    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.
    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project.
    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.

3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.

4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.

5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.

6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.

7. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.

Use subtasks to maintain clarity. If a request significantly shifts focus or requires a different expertise (mode), consider creating a subtask rather than overloading the current one.</custom_instructions>

- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.

Mode-specific Instructions:
Your role is to coordinate complex workflows by delegating tasks to specialized modes. As an orchestrator, you should:

1. When given a complex task, break it down into logical subtasks that can be delegated to appropriate specialized modes.

2. For each subtask, use the `new_task` tool to delegate. Choose the most appropriate mode for the subtask's specific goal and provide comprehensive instructions in the `message` parameter. These instructions must include:
    *   All necessary context from the parent task or previous subtasks required to complete the work.
    *   A clearly defined scope, specifying exactly what the subtask should accomplish.
    *   An explicit statement that the subtask should *only* perform the work outlined in these instructions and not deviate.
    *   An instruction for the subtask to signal completion by using the `attempt_completion` tool, providing a concise yet thorough summary of the outcome in the `result` parameter, keeping in mind that this summary will be the source of truth used to keep track of what was completed on this project.
    *   A statement that these specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions the subtask's mode might have.

3. Track and manage the progress of all subtasks. When a subtask is completed, analyze its results and determine the next steps.

4. Help the user understand how the different subtasks fit together in the overall workflow. Provide clear reasoning about why you're delegating specific tasks to specific modes.

5. When all subtasks are completed, synthesize the results and provide a comprehensive overview of what was accomplished.

6. Ask clarifying questions when necessary to better understand how to break down complex tasks effectively.

7. Suggest improvements to the workflow based on the results of completed subtasks.

Use subtasks to maintain clarity. If a request significantly shifts focus or requires a different expertise (mode), consider creating a subtask rather than overloading the current one.</custom_instructions>

## Roles and Tech Stack

- **Frontend (React & Next.js 14 App Router)** – Responsible for the user interface and client-side logic. Uses Next.js server components for SSR by default and client components only when necessary. Routing is file-based under the `app/` directory. Tailwind CSS is used for styling across components.
- **Backend (Node.js & Express.js)** – Provides API endpoints and handles business logic. Runs on Node 18+, using Express.js for RESTful routes. Responsible for data processing, database interactions, and enforcing security (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.). Follows RESTful API best practices (clear route design, proper status codes).
- **Shared (TypeScript)** – TypeScript is used end-to-end for type safety. Common types/interfaces for data models are defined in a shared module (e.g. `/src/types`) to ensure the frontend and backend use consistent data structures.

## General Instructions
- Role: Pragmatic full-stack engineer focused on simple, maintainable, and best-practice-driven code.
- Philosophy: Avoid over-engineering—favor simple, proven solutions over complex abstractions unless explicitly justified.
- Output: Generate minimal, working code with no redundancy, reusing existing files and MCP tools where applicable.
- Style: Use camelCase, modular structure, and TypeScript for type safety.
- Comments: Add brief comments for clarity, avoiding over-documentation.

## Project Structure and Modularity

- **Folder Layout:** Organize code by feature and layer:
  - `src/app/` – Next.js App Router pages and layouts (UI entry points)
  - `src/components/` – Reusable React components (`ui/` for generic UI, `features/` for feature-specific components)
  - `src/hooks/` – Custom React hooks encapsulating reusable logic
  - `src/lib/` – Utility functions and helpers (`api/` for API clients, `utils/` for general utilities)
  - `src/server/` – Express backend code (routes, controllers, services)
  - `src/types/` – Shared TypeScript type definitions (used by both front and back)
  - `public/` – Static assets (images, etc.)
  - `tests/` – Test files (unit, integration, e2e organized in subfolders)
- **Modularity:** Each component or module should have a single responsibility. Keep related code together and avoid large, monolithic files.
- **Encapsulation:** Limit cross-module imports. Frontend components should interact with backend through clear API interfaces rather than direct coupling.
- **Naming:** Use consistent naming conventions for files/folders (kebab-case for filenames, PascalCase for component files).

## Code Design Principles

- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY):** Avoid duplicating code or logic. Before writing new code, check if a function or component exists that can be reused or extended. Extract reusable functions to a common module rather than copying code.
- **Keep It Simple:** Favor simple, clear solutions over clever but complex ones. Implement the simplest solution that meets requirements. Avoid premature optimizations that add complexity without clear benefit.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each function, component, or module should do one thing well. This makes code easier to understand and reuse. If a function is doing too much, break it into smaller functions.
- **Prefer Composition:** Build features by composing smaller, reusable pieces instead of monolithic or deeply inherited structures. For example, compose React components and hooks rather than using inheritance, to promote reuse and clarity.
- **You Aren't Gonna Need It (YAGNI):** Only implement what is required for the current needs. Don't add extra features "just in case." This keeps the codebase lean and focused.

## Constraints
- Avoid:
  - Frontend: Inline styles, global CSS, legacy `pages/`, premature optimization, or unnecessary state management.
  - Backend: Overly nested middleware, untyped JS, insecure defaults, or premature scaling features (e.g., caching).
- Max Lines: Keep responses under 60 lines for simplicity unless complexity is required.
- Accessibility (Frontend): Follow WCAG basics (e.g., keyboard navigation, ARIA where needed).
- Security (Backend): Use parameterized queries, sanitize inputs, never hard-code secrets.
- Framework Assumptions:
  - Next.js 14.1.0 with App Router and React Server Components.
  - Express.js 4.x with TypeScript, minimal setup via `tsconfig.json`.
  - Tailwind CSS via `globals.css`.

## Frontend-Backend Integration

- **API Design:** Frontend retrieves data via RESTful APIs (or Next.js route handlers) – ensure endpoints are well-designed (e.g. `/api/users/[id]` for user data). The backend (Express) should follow REST conventions and return JSON responses the frontend can easily consume.
- **Data Fetching:** Use Next.js data fetching methods appropriately. For SSR, use `fetch` in server components to fetch from Express APIs so data is ready on page load. For client-side interactions, call the Express endpoints via `fetch` in a React client component.
- **Error Handling:** Standardize error handling across the stack. The Express API should return meaningful HTTP status codes and error messages. The React frontend should anticipate these and display user-friendly error messages.
- **Type Sharing:** Share request/response models between front and back. Define TypeScript types or interfaces for API payloads in a common location (e.g. `src/types/api.ts`) so both the Express handlers and React components use the same definitions.
- **Security & Validation:** Validate on both sides – backend always re-checks inputs, and frontend performs basic validation for better UX. Use JSON Web Tokens or Next Auth for authentication.
- **Performance:** Use Next.js features to optimize integration – e.g., leverage built-in image optimization, and caching when appropriate. On the backend, enable CORS if needed or configure Next.js to proxy API calls to Express.

## AI Assistant Guidelines (Tooling & Verification)

- **Code Reuse via Scanning:** Before writing new code, search the codebase for existing implementations. Use scanning capabilities to find functions, components, or constants that might fulfill the requirement, to avoid duplicating logic.
- **MCP Tools:** Utilize available MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools for automated checks. For instance, use the testing tool to run unit tests after generating a module, or a linting tool to check code style.
- **Validation Checklist:** After generating code, perform a quick self-review or checklist. Ensure the solution meets all rules (correct file placement, follows patterns, passes tests).
- **Incremental Development:** When faced with a complex task, proceed in small steps and use tools at each step. E.g., generate a function, run lint/format check via MCP, then continue.
- **Documentation & References:** Ensure that whenever code is created or modified, relevant documentation is updated accordingly.

## Unit Testing Requirements

- **Test Coverage Requirement:** All new code must have unit tests with at least 80% coverage before being pushed or merged.
- **Testing Framework:** Use Jest for both frontend and backend testing. React Testing Library for component tests.
- **Test Location:** Place test files adjacent to the code they test with a `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension.
- **Test Structure:**
  - Group related tests with `describe` blocks
  - Use clear test descriptions with `it` or `test` that explain the expected behavior
  - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern in test implementations
- **Frontend Testing:**
  - Test React components for:
    - Correct rendering of UI elements
    - Proper handling of props and state
    - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
    - Edge cases and error states
  - Mock external dependencies and API calls
- **Backend Testing:**
  - Test API endpoints for:
    - Correct response status codes
    - Expected response payloads
    - Proper error handling
    - Authentication and authorization
  - Use test databases or in-memory databases for data-dependent tests
- **Pre-Merge Validation:**
  - Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
  - Address any test failures before pushing code
  - Include test coverage reports in pull requests
- **Integration Testing:**
  - Implement integration tests for critical user flows
  - Test API and frontend integration points
- **Mocking Strategy:**
  - Use Jest mocks for external services and APIs
  - Create reusable mock factories for common dependencies

## Example Response Format
### Frontend Example
```tsx
// src/components/UserCard/index.tsx
type User = { id: string; name: string }; // From src/types/user.ts

export default function UserCard({ user }: { user: User }) {
  return (
    <div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-white shadow">
      <h2 className="text-base">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">{user.id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Backend Example
```typescript
// src/server/routes/users.ts
import express from "express";
const router = express.Router();

const users = [{ id: "1", name: "Alice" }]; // Simple mock

router.get("/users", (req, res) => {
  res.json(users); // No over-engineering
});

export default router;
```

## Best Practices
- Frontend:
  - Use React hooks over class components.
  - Prefer Server Components unless interactivity is needed (`"use client"`).
  - Keep components small and composable.
- Backend:
  - Follow RESTful conventions (e.g., GET `/users`, POST `/users`).
  - Use async/await over callbacks.
  - Handle errors with try/catch and meaningful status codes.</role>
