Project Plan: AI Chatbot Integration for FB Consulting Website

1. Project Description and Objectives

Project Overview: This project aims to integrate a fully functional AI chatbot into the Farzad Bayat (FB) Consulting website and complete the site’s static pages. The site will serve as both a marketing website for AI consulting services and a live demo of an AI assistant. Key objectives include:
	•	Persistent AI Chatbot: A globally accessible chat popover (floating modal) on every page, using Vercel’s AI Chatbot UI/UX patterns. The chatbot will stream responses and support rich content (“artifacts” like code blocks, images, etc.) just like the Vercel AI template. Users can trigger it from anywhere on the site – e.g. via a floating chat button or a hero-section input – and the chat history persists as they navigate between pages.
	•	Feature Parity with Vercel Template: The chatbot interface will match the Vercel AI Chatbot’s features, including a chat sidebar with history, message streaming, multimodal input (text and file upload), tool usage (for interactive responses), error/loading states, and accessibility features. All core chat functions (sending messages, viewing AI responses, copying code, etc.) will be implemented and tested.
	•	Complete Website Pages: Build out all content pages with proper layout and styling – Home, About, Services, Contact, and Workshop – according to the provided content and design specs. Each page should have a consistent layout (header, main content sections, optional footer) and reflect the branding (colors, typography) of FB Consulting.
	•	Seamless UX: Ensure smooth navigation and user flow. The header should provide clear navigation links to all pages, and the site should be responsive on mobile and desktop. The chatbot should feel integrated with the site (both visually and contextually), offering help about the site’s services and content in a friendly, informative tone.
	•	Chatbot Alignment with Site Content: Configure the AI assistant’s behavior so it can answer questions about Farzad’s background, services, workshops, etc. The AI’s system prompt and toolset will be customized to include knowledge of the site’s offerings. This way, the chatbot not only demonstrates AI capabilities but also serves as an interactive FAQ for the site.

By achieving these goals, the FB Consulting site will effectively showcase Farzad’s expertise (through rich content and case studies) and provide an engaging AI-powered experience for visitors.

2. Unified Task List

All tasks required to reach the above goals are listed below, grouped by category. (Note: Any tasks marked as previously done in earlier project documents are included here as to-do items, since they may need verification or reimplementation. Dependencies between tasks are noted where applicable.)

Frontend Tasks (Site Layout & Pages)
	•	Initial Layout and Navigation:
	•	Set Up Root Layout: Ensure the Next.js app uses a proper root layout (app/layout.tsx) that wraps all pages. Include the site <head> metadata (title “Farzad Bayat Consulting” and description) and apply the global font (e.g. Inter or brand font). The layout’s <body> should incorporate the main navigation header at the top and possibly a footer at the bottom.
	•	Implement Header Component: Create components/layout/Header.tsx with a responsive navigation bar. It should display the brand name (e.g. “F.B Consulting” with a small accent icon) and links to Home, About, Services, Workshop, Contact. Ensure the header is styled (using Tailwind and shadcn/ui classes) with a sticky top position and a backdrop blur if scrolling. Include a hamburger menu for mobile screens that toggles the nav links, and ensure it closes after clicking a link (for good UX).
	•	Implement Footer (if needed): If a footer is desired (for contact info, copyright, etc.), create components/layout/Footer.tsx. At minimum, ensure the layout pushes content so the footer stays at page bottom. (If no distinct footer content is provided, this can be minimal or skipped.)
	•	Global Chat Trigger in UI: Ensure there is a way to open the chat from any page. This can be a fixed floating button (e.g. a chat icon at bottom-right) or a header element. Implement the trigger using a button (possibly the chat icon from Lucide) that, when clicked, calls the chat store’s openPopover() to display the chatbot. Style this trigger to be prominent yet unobtrusive (e.g. a circular icon button with brand color accent). Dependency: This requires the chat popover component and state (see AI/Chatbot Integration tasks) to be in place.
	•	Home Page (/):
	•	Build Home Hero Section: Use the content from Homepage Content spec to create a compelling hero. The hero should have a bold title (“AI Automation Without the Hype”) and subtitle, and a clear call-to-action button “Book a Free Consultation” linking to Contact. Additionally, include an “Try My AI Assistant” interactive prompt or button. This will be an input field and submit button (the “Ask Bar”) allowing users to type a question. Submitting the form should trigger the chat popover with the query (see AI Integration for hooking functionality). Style the hero with proper padding and a visually appealing background (e.g. a subtle grid or pattern, if provided or using Tailwind utilities) to draw attention.
	•	Why Work With Me Section: Add the “Why Work With Me” content as a brief intro to Farzad’s unique value (bullet points: 10,000+ hours experience, self-taught, built real tools, site runs on his AI assistant). Use a simple list or grid style with check or star icons for each bullet for visual appeal. Include a link “Read My Full Story →” to the About page (or the full story section) as provided.
	•	Services Overview Section: Add a section “What I Offer” summarizing the core offerings: AI Consulting and Hands-On AI Training (Workshops). Use subheadings for each and list the key points (from the content) under each. Keep the styling consistent with the site (maybe two columns or stacked boxes). Include a link “See Services →” to the Services page.
	•	Free Digital Workshop Promo: Insert the “Free Digital Workshop” section content. This should highlight the free 30-minute preview workshop, with a brief description of what users will learn (bulleted list of outcomes). Finish this block with a prominent link “Join Free Workshop →” linking to the Workshop page.
	•	Website as Live Demo Section: Emphasize that the website itself is a live AI demo (from “Proof: My Website is a Live Demo” content). List the features (built with certain AI models, voice/text interaction, personalized responses). Provide a link “Explore the AI Assistant →” – this should trigger or lead to the AI demo (consider linking to /ai-demo or simply using it to open the chat popover with a welcome message).
	•	Results/Testimonials Section: Showcase a few one-line results from real projects (from the content: e.g. “Response time dropped 65%…”, “Reports that took 3 days now 30 seconds,” etc.). These can be styled as quotes or in a grid of cards.
	•	Final Call-to-Action: Conclude the home page with a final CTA (“Ready to use AI that actually works?” and a short prompt to get started). Provide two buttons: “Book Your Free Consultation →” (link to Contact) and “Try the AI Demo →” (again linking or triggering the chat demo).
	•	About Page (/about):
	•	Hero Section: Add the hero from the About content. Title “Self-Taught. Results-Focused. AI That Actually Works.” and subtitle introducing Farzad. Include a CTA button “Book a Free Consultation” linking to Contact.
	•	My Story (Brief): Present the first part of Farzad’s story from 2020 to now. This should be a few paragraphs covering how he started with no background, taught himself through failures, and built successful AI projects. Use the provided text, breaking it into digestible paragraphs for readability. At the end of this section, include a link or button “Read Full Story →” (/about/story) for those interested in the complete story.
	•	How I Work: Highlight Farzad’s working style and principles (bulleted list provided: practical not theoretical, clear explanations, avoid complexity, build fast). Possibly visually differentiate this section (e.g. an aside or call-out style) to emphasize his philosophy. Ensure it’s concise and legible.
	•	Skills & Expertise: List his core skills in a bullet or tag format (AI Automation, Conversational AI, LLM Setup, Vector DBs, etc.). This can be a simple two-column list or a series of badges.
	•	Real Projects: Showcase several real projects with names and brief descriptors (Talk to Eve, ZingZang Lab, iWriter.ai, Optix.io, FarzadAI). A grid or list format is fine. If possible, link any that have external sites (if known) or just list them as examples of experience.
	•	Timeline: Display the timeline of his journey (2020 through 2025 with key milestones). This could be a vertical timeline element or a simple list of years and highlights. Use a muted style for the year and normal text for the description.
	•	Testimonials: Include the three testimonial quotes provided. These could be in italic or blockquote style, possibly with an avatar or initials if available (not provided, so simple quotes with quotation marks). It adds social proof.
	•	Final CTA: End the About page with a call-to-action similar to home: “I’ve done the hard work so you don’t have to… Want a direct path to working AI?” and buttons “Book a Free Consultation” and “Try My AI Assistant”. (Ensure the assistant link triggers the chat or goes to the demo page.)
Missing item: The “Full Story” content is provided after the About content. We need to create an /about/story page (or an expandable section) to display Farzad’s full story in detail. This page should have the complete narrative (from “My Full Story – Farzad Bayat”) with proper formatting (subheadings, paragraphs) since it’s lengthy. If making it a separate page, include a simple layout with a back link to About. Alternatively, implement the “Read Full Story” as a modal or accordion on the About page that reveals this content (this would be a bonus UX feature – ensure it’s scrollable if so). Since the content is already written, it just needs to be presented in a user-friendly way. (Missing item to create from scratch: the full story section/page.)
	•	Services Page (/services):
	•	Hero Section: Title “Practical AI Services That Deliver Results” with subtitle summarizing Farzad’s approach (from content). Include a CTA link “Book a Free Consultation”. Style similarly to other page heroes.
	•	AI Consulting Section: Provide a description of the consulting service (as given: “Hands-on help for companies…”). Under this, list “What I help with” as bullet points (building internal chatbots, automating tasks, deploying private LLMs, MVP building, debugging AI systems). Also list “Good for” (startups, SMEs, ops/support teams, etc.). Use appropriate styling (perhaps two columns on larger screens, or distinct sub-headings for “What I help with” and “Good for”). Finally, include a link “Request a Custom Quote →” linking to Contact for consulting inquiries.
	•	AI Workshops & Training Section: Provide the description (“Teach your team how to use AI tools properly—and build real things.”). Then format the details of the workshop:
	•	“Workshop Format” with the two main bullets (3 hours theory, 3 hours hands-on) – you can make these bold labels followed by descriptions.
	•	“Covered Tools” list (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. – list all given tools).
	•	“Levels” (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced with target audiences).
	•	“Delivery” options (Remote or On-site, includes templates etc.).
This section can be broken into sub-sections or a list of key points as above. Ensure it’s not just one big paragraph – use subheadings like Workshop Format, Tools Covered, Levels, Delivery for clarity.
Include links at the end: “Join Free Digital Preview →” linking to the Workshop page (the free preview might refer to the Workshop page content or a specific section in Workshop page), and “Request a Custom Workshop →” linking to Contact.
	•	Tools & Tech Used: List the tools and technologies Farzad commonly uses (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, LangChain, etc. from content). This can be a simple bullet list or a series of small icon-text pairs if we have icons (not provided, so text list is fine). It serves as keywords for SEO and credibility.
	•	Delivery Process: Outline the process (1. Free consultation, 2. Proposal, 3. Build/test, 4. Follow-up support). Use a numbered list (1–4) format to make it clear it’s a step-by-step process.
	•	Client Outcomes/Testimonies: List the three short quotes provided under “Client Outcomes” (similar to testimonials but specific outcomes). These can be formatted as italic text or quotes within this page.
	•	Final CTA: End with a closing statement (“Let’s scope your use case… get to work.”) and two links: “Book a Free Consultation” and “Try My AI Assistant Now”. The second should trigger the chat or go to the AI demo route.
	•	Workshop Page (/workshop):
	•	Hero Section: Use the title “Hands-On AI Workshops for Your Team” and subtitle “Coming Soon – Get notified when the full workshop schedule is live.” Include a prominent link or button “Join the Waitlist →”. This link currently is written as /#waitlist (which implies scrolling to a waitlist sign-up section on the same page or home). If we have a waitlist form or signup section, implement it. If not, this could simply be an anchor that currently does nothing (to be implemented later) or link to a contact form to express interest. Mark this clearly so users know it’s a placeholder if not functional.
	•	What to Expect: Add the descriptive text explaining the philosophy of the workshops (real-world experience, working understanding by end of day, why many AI tools fail – because teams don’t understand them). Use paragraphs and emphasis where needed. Include the three bullet points highlighting the ground-up approach (no experience required, clear explanations of core concepts, ability to troubleshoot after the workshop). This section sets context, so ensure it’s inviting and not too dense.
	•	Workshop Format: Break out the format details similar to Services page: 3 hours theory and 3 hours hands-on, each with description. Use subheadings or bold text for each part followed by details.
	•	Tools Covered: List the tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) just like in the Services page (they are essentially repeated here). Ensure consistency if listing in both places.
	•	Delivery Options: List the options (On-site in Norway/Europe, Remote globally, includes templates etc.) as bullet points or sub-section.
	•	Why It Works: Use the bullet list given (“You learn by doing”, “You leave with working examples”, etc.) to reinforce the effectiveness of the training. This can be a simple list with a checkmark or lightbulb icon for style.
	•	Stay Updated (Waitlist CTA): At the bottom, prompt the user to stay updated since full workshops are “launching soon.” This should include a brief line and two links: “Join the Waitlist” (same as hero – anchor or form) and “Book a Consultation Instead” (link to Contact page for those who don’t want to wait). If a waitlist signup form or integration (like a newsletter or Mailchimp form) is available, embed it here; otherwise, leave the link as a placeholder anchor and note that the feature is coming soon.
Missing/optional: If no waitlist form or backend exists yet, create a simple static form (email input and submit button) that either connects to an email service or at least collects input (even if it just console.logs or sends to a dummy endpoint). This can be marked for future implementation. For now, clearly mark the workshop page as “Coming Soon” where appropriate.
	•	Contact Page (/contact):
	•	Hero Section: Title “Book a Free AI Consultation” and subtitle “Let’s talk about how AI can reduce costs, streamline workflows…” from content. This sets the stage for reaching out.
	•	Contact Options: Present the two main contact methods:
	•	“🔹 Book a 30-Minute Call”: Provide a brief instruction and a link/button to schedule a call. The content suggests using a Calendly link. Embed the provided Calendly URL in a clear CTA button or link text “Schedule a Call”. Ensure it opens in a new tab (since it’s an external link).
	•	“🔹 Send an Email”: Provide the email (hello@farzadbayat.com) as a mailto link. Include a short note encouraging people to email directly. Use an email icon or emoji for clarity.
These can be styled as two separate blocks or a two-column layout on desktop.
	•	What You Can Expect: List the bullet points given (quick chat to understand needs, honest input on AI fit, no pushy sales, option for proposal). This sets expectations. A simple unordered list with checkmark or dash bullets is fine.
	•	Who I Work With: List the types of clients (“Startups & Scaleups, SMEs & Enterprise Teams, Ops/Product/Support/HR, technical and non-technical”) as bullets or a comma-separated list. This tells visitors if they fit the target audience.
	•	Not Ready Yet? Provide the final nudge: “Try my AI assistant to explore what I do…” followed by a link “→ Try the AI Demo”. This link should invoke the chatbot demo (see note below on the AI demo page). Make it clear that through the AI assistant, they can learn more about Farzad’s work in an interactive way.
	•	AI Demo Page or Link (/ai-demo):
	•	Handle “AI Demo” Links: Throughout the site, there are several references to an /ai-demo page (from Home, Services, Contact CTAs). Decide how to implement this:
	•	Option A: Dedicated AI Demo Page – Create app/ai-demo/page.tsx that essentially contains an embedded chat interface. For example, it could load the global chat component in an expanded view, or prompt the user to start chatting. If using this, ensure that visiting /ai-demo programmatically opens the chat (perhaps by calling openPopover on load or by rendering the chat interface directly on the page).
	•	Option B: Redirect or Trigger – Make the /ai-demo route simply redirect to Home (or another page) and open the chat popover. This might be tricky with Next.js routing, but you could use a client-side effect: on mount of /ai-demo, call useChatStore.getState().openPopover() to open the chat, and perhaps navigate to home.
	•	Option C: No separate page – Simply handle these links via onClick events to open the chat popover without navigation. This requires changing the anchor tags to buttons or intercepting the click.
The simplest approach is a minimal /ai-demo page that just opens the chat. Implement this page so that users who click “Try the AI Demo” get an immediate chat interface. Provide a message or heading like “AI Assistant Demo” and then the chat component. This ensures the links don’t 404. (Missing item to create: /ai-demo route handling as described.)
	•	Persistent Chat State: Ensure that if the user navigates to /ai-demo (or anywhere) and the chat is open, the conversation state is not lost. Since we intend the chat component to live in the root layout, it will persist. If implementing a dedicated page that mounts its own chat, consider syncing with the global chat state or using the same store so that it’s the same conversation.
	•	Routing & Navigation Checks:
	•	Link Checks: Go through all internal links on each page to verify they point to the correct routes (e.g. Home link is “/”, “Read My Full Story” goes to the full story page or reveals the content, “Join Free Workshop” goes to /workshop, etc.). Also ensure external links (Calendly, mailto) work and open correctly.
	•	404 Handling: (Optional) Implement a custom 404 page via app/[...missing]/page.tsx to catch any broken links, just with a friendly message and link back to home. Not critical, but a nice touch.
	•	Responsive Design: Manually test each page on various screen sizes. Ensure headings, lists, and sections reflow nicely on mobile (no cut-off text or awkward spacing). The hero sections should still look appealing on small screens (perhaps smaller text, stacked layout). Adjust Tailwind breakpoints or classes as needed for good responsiveness.

Backend Tasks (API & Data Layer)
	•	Project Setup & Dependencies:
	•	Install/Verify Dependencies: Ensure all required packages are installed and up to date. This includes Next.js 13+ (App Router), Tailwind CSS (with postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js properly set up), shadcn/ui component library (Radix UI components for React) initialized, Vercel AI SDK (ai package), and Zustand for state management. Run npm install or pnpm install for packages like @vercel/ai (or ai), @ai-sdk/openai (if using OpenAI provider), zustand, lucide-react (for icons), etc.
	•	Disable Authentication Middleware: The original template may include next-auth for authentication and an auth middleware redirect. Remove or comment out any auth requirements so that the chatbot can be used without logging in. This means deleting or disabling the middleware.ts that enforces auth and ensuring any references to useSession or protected routes are stripped out. The site will run in “guest mode” for now.
	•	Environment Variables: Prepare the .env.local file with necessary API keys and settings. At minimum, set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key> (if using OpenAI) or relevant keys for the chosen model provider. If the Vercel AI SDK default (xAI/Groq model) is used, ensure any needed key or model ID is configured. Also include any database connection strings if persistence is implemented (for example, a Postgres URL for Neon if storing chat history).
	•	Choose AI Model Provider: Decide which AI model to use for chatbot responses. By default, we can use OpenAI’s GPT-4 or GPT-3.5 via the OpenAI class in the Vercel SDK. Alternatively, the template’s default is an X.AI model (grok-2-1212). For simplicity and alignment with content (which mentions ChatGPT, Claude, etc.), using OpenAI is fine. Configure the backend to use the chosen model (e.g., OpenAI’s GPT-4). This might involve slight code changes in the API route (model name or provider import).
	•	Chat API Route (/api/chat):
	•	Implement API Endpoint: Create the Next.js route at app/api/chat/route.ts to handle chat requests. This route will accept a POST with { messages: Message[] } (the chat history and new prompt) and should stream back the AI’s response. Use Vercel’s AI SDK function streamText() or similar to handle the streaming response.
	•	System Prompt & AI Initialization: Within the API route, initialize the AI model client (e.g., new OpenAI() with the API key implicitly loaded). Define a system prompt that sets the assistant’s role and knowledge: for example, “You are a helpful AI assistant for a consulting website. You can answer questions about Farzad’s services, background, and AI concepts. Be friendly and informative, and use an engaging, professional tone.” Make sure to include in the prompt that it can use tools for specific queries (like providing service details or confirming actions).
	•	Tool Definitions (server-side): Implement the tools using the AI SDK’s tool() utility and Zod schemas:
	•	getServiceInformation tool: This tool will provide details about a specific consulting service or offering. Define its parameters schema with a string serviceName. In the execute function, provide relevant info from the site content. For example, if serviceName includes “consulting” or matches an offering, return an object with details like description, duration, and maybe a price range if applicable. Use the actual content from the Services page to make these details accurate (e.g., if the user asks about “AI Workshops”, return key points: it’s a 6-hour training, covers X tools, available remote/on-site). If the serviceName isn’t recognized, return a message indicating which services are available (to guide the user).
	•	askForConfirmation tool: This tool is used when the AI wants to confirm something with the user (yes/no question). Define its parameters with a message: string. Do not implement an execute for this on the server – we handle it on the client. The presence of this tool in the AI’s response will signal the client UI to prompt the user. (We just need to declare it so the AI knows it exists and can call it.)
	•	Stream Response with Tools: Use streamText() (or experimental_generateStream) in the API route to generate the assistant response. Pass the messages from the request, the system prompt, and include the tools object with the two tools defined above. The Vercel SDK will take care of invoking the tool if the assistant decides to call one. Ensure streamText is called with the chosen model (e.g., aiProvider.chat('openai/gpt-4') or similar, depending on SDK usage).
	•	Return Streaming Response: Use the result of streamText() to return a streaming response (return result.toDataStreamResponse();). This will send events to the client as the AI responds. Verify that this setup works by testing the API independently (e.g., via curl or a REST client with a sample prompt).
	•	Error Handling: Add basic error handling in the route. If the AI SDK throws an error (network issue, invalid key, etc.), catch it and return an appropriate error response with status 500 and an error message. The client will need to handle this (show an error in the chat UI).
	•	Data Persistence (Chat History Storage): [Optional/Advanced]
	•	Persist Conversations: For full parity with the template, implement a way to save chat history so that returning users or multiple sessions can be stored. This could be done via a database (the Vercel template uses Neon Postgres). If using a DB, set up a simple schema to store messages with a conversation ID, user identifier (if any, but since auth is off, perhaps by an anonymous session token), etc. Alternately, use local storage or IndexedDB in the browser to save the conversation state between visits for the same user.
	•	Load Saved History: If persistence is implemented, modify the app to load existing conversation history into the sidebar on component mount (for example, fetch from /api/history or read from local storage). Allow the user to pick up where they left off. This ties into the frontend sidebar management (see AI Integration tasks).
	•	Conversation Management: If multiple conversations are stored, the backend should support creating a new conversation context. This might be as simple as generating a new conversation ID when the user clicks “New Chat” (which the client can handle by clearing the messages and maybe informing the server to start fresh context without prior messages). Ensure the API route can handle multiple contexts if needed (e.g., via a conversationId passed in the request). This is an advanced feature; if time is short, it can be deferred, with the chatbot operating in a single-session mode.
	•	Other Backend Considerations:
	•	File Upload Support: If the chatbot is to support file inputs (for example, the user uploads a PDF or image for analysis), the backend needs an endpoint or direct handling in the chat route for file data. The Vercel template uses Vercel Blob for file storage. For now, if focusing on parity, ensure the UI allows file upload (see frontend tasks) and decide how to handle it. Perhaps disable actual processing (just ignore the file) unless we integrate a simple file tool. Mark this as a future enhancement if not implemented now.
	•	Testing the API: Once the API and tools are in place, test with various scenarios:
	•	Ask the assistant a general question (should get a normal AI answer).
	•	Ask about a specific service (“What do you do in AI consulting?”) – the assistant should ideally use the getServiceInformation tool to fetch details.
	•	Trigger the confirmation flow (perhaps the system prompt or a hidden prompt can instruct the assistant to use askForConfirmation next). This is tricky to simulate, but you can temporarily force a tool call in the system prompt for testing.
Ensure responses are streaming properly and no CORS or other issues occur.

AI/Chatbot Integration Tasks (Chat UI & Logic)
	•	Global State Management:
	•	Create Chat Store (Zustand): Set up a global Zustand store (e.g. in stores/chatStore.ts) to manage the chatbot’s UI state. The store should include:
	•	isPopoverOpen: boolean (whether the chat modal is open),
	•	initialQuery: string | null (a query to pre-populate when opening, if triggered by the hero ask bar or link),
	•	Actions: openPopover(query?: string), closePopover(), and setInitialQuery(query: string).
	•	The openPopover action should set isPopoverOpen = true and if a query is passed, set initialQuery to that query. The closePopover should reset both isPopoverOpen to false and initialQuery to null. This store will allow any part of the app (like header, hero, or chat components) to control the chat popover.
	•	Persist Chat State in Layout: In the Root Layout component (app/layout.tsx), integrate the global chat component so it’s always mounted. Import the GlobalChatPopover (see below) and render it just above the closing </body> tag, so it overlays on top of any page. This ensures the chat UI persists across route changes (the layout is not remounted). Confirm that the Zustand store is not losing state between navigations (Zustand’s state by default will persist in memory as long as the page is not fully reloaded).
	•	Chat Popover/Modal Component:
	•	Create GlobalChatPopover Component: Develop components/GlobalChatPopover.tsx as a client component that wraps the entire chat UI in a portal or popover. This component should:
	•	Use Radix UI’s Popover or Dialog (from shadcn/ui) to handle the overlay and positioning, or implement a custom modal using a React portal. Given the need for full-screen-ish interface and accessibility (ESC to close, click outside to close), a Dialog might be appropriate.
	•	Contain the trigger button and the content area for the chat. For example, the structure can be: <Popover open={isPopoverOpen} onOpenChange={...}> <PopoverTrigger>...trigger button...</PopoverTrigger> <PopoverContent>...chat interface...</PopoverContent> </Popover>. The trigger could also live outside if using a different approach; what’s important is PopoverContent houses the chat UI.
	•	The trigger button: possibly the floating button with a chat icon (if not placed in header). This button should be visible when isPopoverOpen is false (and maybe hidden when open if using Popover from shadcn which auto-hides trigger when open). Clicking it calls openPopover(). Give it an accessible label (aria-label like “Open AI Chat”).
	•	The content: a container div that will ultimately contain the chat interface component (ChatUI). In early phases, you can put a placeholder or a temporary close button. Set the content container’s class to a fixed size (e.g. width ~400px on desktop, 90vw on mobile, and height ~70vh on mobile, ~550px on desktop, as in the spec) and appropriate positioning (if using Popover from shadcn, it will position relative to trigger by default; for a modal style, you may want a full-screen backdrop).
	•	The popover/modal should close on outside click or when the user presses Escape. Radix Dialog/Popover can handle this if configured. Also, provide a explicit close “X” button inside the chat header (for user clarity, especially on mobile).
	•	Dependency: This component will use the Zustand store. On mount/effect, it might check if an initialQuery exists (set by hero ask bar) and if so, open the popover. Also, when the popover opens, if initialQuery is set, it can be passed into the chat as the first user message (see ChatInterface below for handling that).
	•	Style the Modal: Use Tailwind to style the Chat Popover. It should appear above the site content (use a high z-index). Possibly darken the background or apply a semi-transparent backdrop when open (for focus). The container should have a white (or surface) background with rounded corners (if not full screen), and drop shadow for contrast. Ensure it’s responsive: on mobile, it may occupy most of the screen for usability; on desktop, it can appear as a chat window in the corner.
	•	Integrate Close Mechanisms: The user should be able to close the chat by:
	•	Clicking outside the modal area (should trigger onInteractOutside -> closePopover),
	•	Pressing Escape key (if using Dialog from Radix, set onEscapeKeyDown to closePopover),
	•	Clicking a close button (if provided in the chat UI header).
Implement these so that the chat can be easily dismissed, returning the user to browsing the site.
	•	Chat Interface Component:
	•	Create ChatUI/ChatInterface Component: Develop a component (e.g. components/ChatInterface.tsx) as the core of the chat popover content. Mark it 'use client' because it will manage state and hooks. This component will utilize the Vercel AI SDK’s useChat hook to handle the conversation state and API calls.
	•	Integrate useChat: Inside ChatInterface, call useChat from the ai/react package. This hook likely takes an endpoint (which should be our /api/chat route), and possibly options like experimental_onToolCall and onFinish for handling tool usage (discussed below). useChat returns an object with properties: messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit, isLoading, error, append, reload, stop, etc. Use these to manage the chat UI.
	•	Initial Message Handling: If chatStore.initialQuery is set (meaning the user triggered the chat with a question), we want to send that as the first user message automatically. Implement logic such that when ChatInterface mounts or when it notices a non-null initialQuery in the store, it calls append({ role: 'user', content: initialQuery }) (or an equivalent method) to send that message, then clears the initialQuery in the store. This will prompt the AI to respond immediately after opening.
	•	Layout: Structure ChatInterface with three main parts:
	1.	Chat Messages List – a scrollable area showing the conversation,
	2.	Input Area – a text input (or textarea) with a send button for the user to type new messages,
	3.	(Optionally) Sidebar toggle or additional toolbar – if including a sidebar or controls (on larger screens).
Use a parent container flex column that fills the popover, so the messages list can expand and then the input stays at bottom.
	•	Messages List: Create a sub-component or JSX block for the messages. You can make a MessageList component that takes messages and maps over them. For each message:
	•	Determine if it’s from the user or the assistant (usually message.role is ‘user’ or ‘assistant’).
	•	Render a styled message bubble: e.g. user messages on right side (or with one color background), assistant on left (different background). Include an icon or avatar if desired: perhaps use a user icon (or user’s initials) for user, and a bot icon for assistant. Keep it simple but distinct. Also handle system or tool messages if any appear (though typically useChat might not show system in the list).
	•	If the message has an associated “artifact” (like a code block or image), render the appropriate artifact component (see Artifact handling below).
	•	Input Area: At the bottom, provide a form with a textarea or input and a submit button. The useChat hook’s input state and handleInputChange, handleSubmit should be wired up here. For example, <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> <textarea value={input} onChange={handleInputChange} ... /> <button type="submit">Send</button> </form>. Use a Send icon (paper airplane) next to or on the button for clarity. The input should be disabled or readonly while isLoading is true (to prevent sending additional messages while one is in progress).
	•	For accessibility and UX, pressing Enter (with no Shift) in the textarea should submit (you might use a single-line input for simplicity if not supporting multi-line).
	•	Include placeholder text like “Ask me anything…” that maybe changes to a shorter prompt on mobile.
	•	Loading and Error States: Inside the ChatInterface, handle the isLoading flag by perhaps showing a “Typing…” or spinner indicator in the chat. An easy way is to have a temporary message element at the bottom of the messages list saying “AI is thinking…” when loading. Also, if error is non-null (meaning the last request failed), display an error message in the chat (like an assistant bubble saying “Sorry, something went wrong. Please try again.”). Provide a way to clear the error (sending a new message could reset it).
	•	Scroll Management: When a new message comes in, ensure the messages list scrolls to the bottom. You can use a ref on the list or an effect that triggers on messages length change. Alternatively, using Radix ScrollArea component for the messages container can automatically handle some scrolling. We want the newest messages visible without user manually scrolling.
	•	Sidebar (optional initially): The Vercel template has a sidebar for conversation history and maybe settings. To keep things simple, you can initially omit the sidebar or keep it hidden. But for parity:
	•	Consider implementing a Sidebar component (maybe slide-out on mobile, always visible on desktop to the left of chat content) showing a list of past conversations or a welcome message. Since we have no auth, this could just be a static area with a “New Chat” button and maybe placeholder for future use.
	•	You might integrate a SidebarProvider as in the template which manages showing/hiding. This is an advanced enhancement; you can stub it for now with minimal functionality.
	•	Tool Interaction Hooks: Use the experimental_onToolCall (or similar hook from useChat) to intercept tool calls:
	•	When the askForConfirmation tool is invoked by the AI (the AI’s message might include a tool call instead of direct content), the hook should give you the tool name and parameters. In this case, you would NOT immediately finalize the assistant’s message. Instead, render within the chat an interactive UI asking the user to confirm. For example, when tool askForConfirmation comes in with { message: "Are you sure you want to proceed?" }, the ChatInterface can display that question with “Yes and No buttons for the user. Those buttons, when clicked, should call useChat().addToolResult({ name: 'askForConfirmation', result: <user's answer> }) – effectively sending the user’s decision back to the AI stream. The AI then continues the response based on that.
	•	For the getServiceInformation tool, the experimental_onToolCall could directly fetch or compute the result (perhaps by calling a helper that has the same logic as the API or simply trusting the API already returned an object). However, since we handle it server-side (the API’s execute returns an object), the AI’s message will contain that object. The AI SDK might either finalize that message as an assistant message containing a structured result, or we may need to catch it and format it. If needed, when a getServiceInformation call returns, you can format the result into a nice response (e.g., show a small card with service details in the chat).
	•	This is complex; ensure at least that the UI doesn’t crash when these tools are called. A simple approach: if message.content is an object or there’s an additionalProps indicating tool usage, just output JSON for now or a formatted text. Then refine later to pretty UI.
	•	Artifacts Rendering: The assistant might return various content types: e.g., code blocks (with triple backticks), images (maybe via a URL in response), or even tabular data. Implement special handling for these:
	•	For code: If a message content contains a code block, render it using a <pre><code> block with proper styling (maybe use shadcn/ui’s CodeBlock or a light prism highlighter). Also, add a small “Copy” button in the corner of the code block so user can copy the snippet easily.
	•	For images: If the assistant returns an image URL or base64 (less likely unless using tools), render an <Image> component. Ensure to set proper width or max-width so it fits in the chat bubble.
	•	For any structured tool response (like the object from getServiceInformation), present it neatly: e.g., show each field on a new line or in a small card with labels.
	•	Test by simulating a response with code (you can have the AI respond with a code example) and ensure it formats nicely.
	•	Chat UI Parity Features: Ensure the following features present in the Vercel template are addressed:
	•	A model selector (if needed): The original had a dropdown to choose different models. For our scope, we might skip multiple models. Optionally, provide a non-functional dropdown or a label showing the current model (“GPT-4”) for completeness.
	•	Theme toggle integration: If the site supports dark mode (the header tasks mentioned a theme toggle), make sure the chat UI also responds to theme changes (e.g., use Tailwind’s dark: classes or context from Next Theme). This ensures the chat bubbles, background, etc., have appropriate dark mode styles.
	•	Mobile full-screen behavior: On small screens, probably use the full screen for chat instead of a small popover. Test this and adjust classes (maybe use sm:w-[400px] w-full h-full for PopoverContent on mobile).
	•	Accessibility: All interactive elements in ChatInterface (send button, file upload button, close button, etc.) should have aria-label or appropriate roles. Also manage focus: when the chat opens, perhaps autofocus the input field. Trap focus within the modal if using a modal (so tab key doesn’t go behind the modal).
	•	Keyboard shortcuts: Escape to close as mentioned. Maybe Ctrl+Enter to submit (if multi-line input is allowed).
	•	Streaming UI: As the message streams in, you might see partial content. The useChat hook likely handles updating the last message incrementally. Make sure your message render can handle the assistant’s latest message updating (e.g., don’t key the message list items in a way that it replaces the node each time mid-stream; ideally key by message id).
	•	Stopping Generation: The template might have a “Stop” button to halt a streaming response. The useChat hook provides a stop() function. Optionally, implement a “Stop” button that is visible while isLoading (a small “Stop” or an X icon next to the loading indicator) that calls stop().
	•	Regenerate: Similarly, a “Regenerate response” action might be present after an answer. You can implement a simple one: after an assistant response, allow the user to click a “↻ Regenerate” which essentially resends the last user message by calling reload() from the hook (if available) or just calling the API with the same last prompt again. This is also optional but common in chat UIs.
	•	Hero “Ask Bar” Integration:
	•	Connect Homepage Ask Bar: On the Home page, integrate the hero ask form with the chat. The form’s submit handler should call the chat store’s openPopover with the query. Implement this as per spec: use useChatStore() in the Home page component, and on form submit, if the input is not empty, call openPopover(inputValue). This will set initialQuery and open the chat. The ChatInterface (listening to initialQuery) will then send it. After calling, clear the hero input field. This provides a seamless experience where the user types a question on the homepage and immediately the AI assistant pops up with an answer.
	•	Trigger via Links: Similarly, any link like “Try the AI Demo” could be enhanced: if it’s a regular link to /ai-demo, we handle it on that page as described. But if we want, we can also intercept clicks on those links (especially on the same page) to open the popover. For example, on the Contact page’s “Try the AI Demo” link, we might attach an onClick that calls openPopover() and prevents navigation. This is an enhancement for immediate UX.
	•	Test Ask Bar: Verify that typing a question in the hero input and pressing submit does open the chat and that the question appears as a sent message, followed by an AI answer. Also ensure that if the chat was already open, the behavior is sane (maybe it just adds a new message or focuses the chat).
	•	Conversation Sidebar & Multi-Chat (Advanced):
	•	Implement Sidebar UI: For parity, implement a chat sidebar within the ChatPopover that can list past conversations and allow switching. On large screens, this could be a panel on the left of the chat content; on small screens, it might be a slide-over drawer. Create a ChatSidebar.tsx component that displays:
	•	A list of conversation entries (could be just “Conversation 1”, “Conversation 2”, or if we generate titles from the first user question).
	•	A “+ New Chat” button to start a fresh conversation.
	•	(If authentication were on, user info or login button would be here, but we skip that).
For now, without a backend store, you can maintain conversation list in Zustand or local state. If using localStorage for persistence, load any saved conversations.
	•	Conversation Switching Logic: When the user selects a conversation from the sidebar, load its messages into the ChatInterface. If using useChat, this is tricky because useChat maintains its own state. You might need to unmount and remount ChatInterface with a new key (like key={activeConversationId}) so it reinitializes to that conversation’s messages. Alternatively, manage messages outside of useChat (not ideal). Given complexity, you could simulate multiple chats by simply clearing and starting new ones (perhaps the New Chat button just clears the messages array in the hook by some method).
	•	Persisting Conversations: If a database or local storage is set up (from backend tasks), integrate it: on new message or at intervals, save the conversation. On load, fetch existing conversations.
	•	Sidebar Toggle: Ensure on small screens the sidebar can be toggled (the template had a hamburger menu in the chat header for showing/hiding the sidebar). Implement a button in the chat header that toggles a state sidebarOpen. On mobile, that could overlay the conversation list. On desktop, maybe the sidebar is always visible (no toggle needed).
	•	UI Polish for Sidebar: Style the active conversation highlight, the hover states for items, and ensure the New Chat button is distinct. Keep the sidebar slim (maybe 250px width). Possibly use an icon (comments or chat bubbles icon) as a placeholder if no conversations exist, saying “No past chats”.
Note: Multi-conversation support is a stretch goal. If time or complexity is an issue, you can limit to a single conversation (i.e., the sidebar simply isn’t shown). However, list it here for completeness toward full parity.
	•	Testing Chat UX:
	•	Manual Chat Testing: After implementing the above, thoroughly test the chat end-to-end in the browser:
	•	Open the site, click the chat trigger, send a basic question (“What services do you offer?”). The AI should respond with info (likely invoking the service tool).
	•	Test the hero ask bar: type a question and submit – see that the popover opens and the conversation flows.
	•	If possible, test the askForConfirmation flow. (One way: temporarily adjust the system prompt to force a confirmation, e.g., “The next question user asks, reply by asking for confirmation.” Then see if the UI shows Yes/No and clicking them continues the chat.)
	•	Test sending multiple messages, long messages, etc., to see that scroll and input behave.
	•	Try uploading a file if that feature is present (ensure it doesn’t break anything, even if it doesn’t process the file).
	•	Ensure that closing and reopening the popover retains the current conversation (since the component remains mounted in layout, it should).
	•	Navigate to another page while chat is open (the chat should stay open and keep state).
	•	Refresh the page (state will reset unless persistence implemented; that’s okay if not implemented).
	•	Try mobile view: use device emulator or actual phone. The chat UI should expand nicely and still be usable (input accessible, etc.). Also test orientation changes.
	•	Refine Based on Testing: Fix any issues found (e.g., messages not scrolling into view, input not focusing, incorrect data from tool, etc.). Tweak styles for consistency (for instance, ensure the font and colors used in chat match the rest of the site’s theme).

Design & UX Tasks (Styling, Theming, Accessibility)
	•	Branding and Theming:
	•	Tailwind Theme Configuration: Ensure Tailwind is configured with the project’s brand colors and fonts. For example, define a primary color in tailwind.config.js to match Farzad’s brand (if a specific color is desired – e.g., a blue or green). The content uses classes like text-primary and text-muted-foreground (the latter suggests you might be using shadcn’s default palette). Verify that primary and other semantic colors (foreground, background, muted, etc.) are set either via shadcn’s default or custom config. If not, customize them now.
	•	Apply Consistent Typography: Use a consistent font (Inter or any Google Font specified). The root layout likely already imports Inter. Make sure all headings and text use Tailwind classes that correspond to a consistent scale (e.g., use text-4xl for main hero headings, text-xl for section headings, etc., as provided in content examples). Check that these match the intended style. Possibly utilize a Tailwind Typography plugin for the long-form story content to ensure it’s nicely formatted.
	•	Color and Style Alignment: Match the color scheme across components:
	•	Buttons and links should use the primary color or a variant for hover states.
	•	The chat trigger button might use the primary color background with a contrasting icon (or an outline variant that matches branding).
	•	Section backgrounds: consider using slight gray or off-white backgrounds to delineate sections if needed (the content is segmented by horizontal rules — in the docs; in implementation, you can use <hr> or background color blocks).
	•	Ensure the “glowing dot” accent in the header (mentioned in completed tasks) is implemented: e.g., a small colored circle or an element in the brand name that has a subtle glow effect to give a unique touch.
	•	The site likely has a light theme by default; if dark mode toggle is present, ensure all components including chat have appropriate dark: styles (e.g., chat bubbles should invert colors in dark mode, background changes, etc.). Test dark mode if possible (toggle and see).
	•	Images and Media: If any images (like a logo, background pattern, or icons) are to be used:
	•	Integrate the logo: If Farzad has a logo image and it’s available, add it to public/ and include it in the header (as per header component snippet). If not, using the text name is fine.
	•	Favicon: Ensure a favicon is set (maybe using a simple generated one if not provided).
	•	If using any decorative imagery (e.g., background shapes for hero sections), include those assets or create them with CSS. The mention of a “grid background” for hero could be accomplished with a CSS background image or using a SVG pattern. This is optional polish.
	•	Button Styles: Review all buttons (CTA buttons, the chat send and close buttons, etc.) to ensure they have a consistent style. Use Tailwind utility classes or shadcn button variants. Primary actions (like “Book Consultation”) might be solid primary color buttons with white text. Secondary or link buttons (like “Try AI Demo”) might be styled differently (outline or link style). Ensure hover and focus states are defined (e.g., slightly darker background on hover).
	•	Spacing and Layout: Use consistent padding and margin between sections and elements. The content suggests certain padding (e.g., py-8 or py-16 for sections). Ensure section headings have margin below, lists have proper spacing, etc. This will improve readability.
	•	Responsive Typography: Consider using responsive text sizes for major headings (Tailwind’s responsive utilities, e.g., text-4xl md:text-5xl for the main hero title as suggested in the content). This ensures the site looks good on small and large screens without overly large text on small devices.
	•	Chatbot UI Polish:
	•	Chat Modal Styling: Refine the chat modal appearance to be clean and on-brand:
	•	Set the chat header (if you have one inside the modal) with a title or greeting (maybe just an icon and “Chat Assistant”). The header can use the primary color as a background or have a bottom border to separate it from messages.
	•	Style user message bubbles perhaps with a distinct color (maybe primary or a light variant of it) and assistant bubbles in a neutral color (gray or theme background). Keep contrast high for readability. Optionally, show a small avatar circle: you can use a generic user icon for the user and a robot icon for the assistant.
	•	Ensure the input area is clearly separated. Perhaps put a light border on top of the input area container.
	•	If the chat popover content area has rounded corners and is not full-screen, ensure content doesn’t overflow the rounded edges (apply overflow-hidden if needed).
	•	If any artifact (like code block) extends beyond the width, make it scrollable horizontally rather than overflowing.
	•	Transitions and Animations: Add subtle animations to improve UX:
	•	When the chat modal opens/closes, use a fade or slide transition so it’s not jarring. (Radix Dialog can handle some of this with motion or one can use Tailwind transitions).
	•	For new messages, you might fade them in or slide them up slightly. Don’t overdo it, but a subtle transition can make the appearance smoother.
	•	The hero “Ask AI” button could have a small hover animation (like a slight scale up or glow).
	•	Loading Indicator: If not already done, add a small spinner or animated ellipsis when waiting for the AI response. This could be in the chat message area (e.g., an assistant message that just shows a typing indicator). There are many ways (CSS animating three dots, or a spinner icon). This provides feedback during potentially long AI responses.
	•	Error Message UI: Design the error state in chat clearly. If the AI request fails, the assistant area can show a message like “Sorry, I’m having trouble right now. Please try again.” possibly with a warning icon. Maybe style it in a red-ish bubble or text to indicate an error. Provide a quick action to retry (the user can hit “Regenerate” or just ask again).
	•	File Upload UI (if enabled): If the chat input includes an attachment button, style the file input. Possibly show a preview of the attached file name or icon in the input area once selected. If implementing artifact previews, ensure they look integrated (for example, if a PDF is “uploaded”, you might show a message bubble indicating the file was uploaded or being processed).
	•	Tool Result Styling: For the getServiceInformation results or any structured data returned by tools, design these within the chat. For example, if the assistant used the tool to fetch details about “AI Workshops”, you could present the result as a mini card: title, description, duration, cost, etc., extracted from the returned object. This is more engaging than raw JSON. Similarly, the confirmation tool’s UI (Yes/No buttons) should match the chat style (maybe inline buttons with small size styling inside a special assistant message).
	•	Accessibility & UX Enhancements:
	•	Keyboard Navigation: Ensure that all interactive elements are reachable and usable via keyboard. The header nav links should be focusable in order and the skip link (if implemented) should be the first focus on tab. The chat open button should be in the tab order (perhaps after the main nav or at end of the page), and when it opens, focus should move to the chat input. Within the chat modal, trap focus (so Tab cycles through close button, messages (if focusable?), input, etc., and doesn’t go behind modal). Use aria-modal or Radix Dialog to handle focus trapping.
	•	Aria Labels & Roles: Add aria-label or aria-hidden appropriately. Examples: the chat trigger button should have aria-label="Open AI chat assistant". The close button in chat aria-label="Close chat". The form input should have a label (visually hidden label like “Type your message”). If using landmarks or regions, label the chat region with a role (maybe role="dialog" and aria-label="AI Assistant chat").
	•	Skip to Content: If not already, implement a “Skip to main content” link at the very top of the page for screen readers/keyboard. This was noted as done in header improvements: typically, a link that becomes visible on focus, leading to the main content section (give the main container an id and link to #main).
	•	Contrast and Font Sizes: Check that text color contrast is sufficient against backgrounds for accessibility (use accessible colors for text on primary buttons, etc.). Ensure font sizes are not too small; base text should be around 1rem (16px) or larger for body.
	•	Responsive Touch Areas: On mobile, make sure touch targets are large enough. Buttons should not be too small to tap. Padding and margins might need to be increased for small screens on interactive elements.
	•	Testing Accessibility: Optionally, run an accessibility checker (like Lighthouse or AXE) to catch any major issues and fix them.

Content Integration Tasks
	•	Populate Page Content:
	•	Insert Provided Copy: For each page (Home, About, Services, Workshop, Contact), use the exact text given in the content files. Double-check that no section is missed. All headings, paragraphs, bullets, and CTA links from the markdown specs should appear on the site. Maintain the formatting (e.g., bold text where indicated, punctuation, and line breaks).
	•	Proofreading & Tone: As you integrate text, ensure it flows well. Minor edits for consistency (like capitalizing consistently, or adjusting a phrase for the web context) are fine, but keep the tone as given (friendly, first-person where used, and professional). The content is mostly in first person (“I offer… my story…”), which is appropriate since Farzad is speaking through the site.
	•	Link Hookup: Make sure all embedded links in the content go to the right destinations:
	•	Internal links: “Read My Full Story” → /about/story (to be created), “See Services” → /services, “Join Free Workshop” → /workshop, “Try My AI Assistant” or “AI Demo” → trigger chat or /ai-demo, etc.
	•	External links: Calendly link (ensure it uses Farzad’s actual scheduling link if available, right now it’s a placeholder yourlink – replace with correct one if known), mailto link for email (test it triggers an email client).
	•	Hash link: “/#waitliston Workshop – if you implement a waitlist section, assign anid=“waitlist”to that section or form in Workshop or Home. If not implementing, consider changing this to just stay on the workshop page and maybe open a modal or display a message that one can’t join yet. At minimum, it should not navigate to a non-existent location – possibly remove the slash (just#waitlist`) to refer to the same page’s element.
	•	Missing Content Gaps: Identify if any content is still missing or marked TBD:
	•	The “Full Story” was provided, we covered that as a needed page.
	•	No explicit content for a footer – if we want one, we might just put something simple like © 2025 Farzad Bayat or links to social media if any (not provided, so optional).
	•	The site doesn’t list any Privacy Policy/Terms (likely not needed for this stage).
	•	If any section in provided content said “Coming Soon” or was incomplete (the workshop page itself is a coming soon scenario), just ensure that’s clearly communicated.
	•	Content Formatting: Some content items include emojis or special characters (e.g., “🔹” used as a bullet on Contact). Render these appropriately (they can be kept as is since modern browsers handle emojis). The bullet lists can either use the emoji as the bullet or incorporate it into the text. Preserve these because they add personality to the content.
	•	SEO Considerations: Use proper heading levels (each page should have one h1 – the hero title, then h2 for section titles, etc.). Next.js app router pages allow setting metadata; ensure each page’s <title> and <description> are set in the page file or layout accordingly (for example, About page title “About – Farzad Bayat” etc.). This improves clarity and SEO.
	•	Align Chatbot Responses with Content:
	•	Update System Prompt/Persona: Revisit the system prompt in the API route to include details from the content. For example: “You are a helpful assistant for Farzad Bayat’s consulting website. You have knowledge of Farzad’s background (self-taught AI consultant, 10k+ hours experience since 2020), his services (AI consulting, AI workshops), and how his AI assistant works. Use information from the site to answer questions about Farzad, his services, and AI in business. If you don’t know an answer, respond helpfully and suggest contacting Farzad.” This ensures the AI’s tone and knowledge are aligned out-of-the-box.
	•	Incorporate Key Q&A Information: To make the chatbot truly useful, consider giving it direct knowledge of some site facts. This can be done in a few ways:
	•	Expand the system prompt or initial messages with key facts (e.g., a hidden assistant message that lists services and their details, or a snippet of Farzad’s bio). This will guide the AI’s answers without needing to always call a tool.
	•	Or use the getServiceInformation tool logic to cover all relevant offerings. Ensure that if the user asks about “workshops” or “consultation”, the AI either knows from prompt or uses the tool to fetch the answer. Test questions like “What is this free workshop about?” or “What do you do in your consulting service?” to see if it provides accurate info from the content.
	•	If time permits and for advanced alignment, you could embed the content of pages in a vector database and have the AI tool query it. This is complex, so not required now – the simpler approach is fine.
	•	Test Content Q&A: Ask the chatbot sample questions:
	•	“Who is Farzad Bayat?” (expect it to summarize from About page),
	•	“What services do you offer?” (expect an overview or two main services),
	•	“Can you tell me about the AI workshop?” (should list some features of the workshop),
	•	“How do I contact you?” (it should direct to booking a call or emailing, as per Contact info),
	•	“What results have you achieved?” (maybe it can mention one of the provided results or direct to examples).
If the AI struggles on any of these, you might need to tweak the prompt or add more hints. The goal is the chatbot feels integrated and knowledgeable, not generic.
	•	Content from Scratch (if any missing):
	•	Provide Any Unwritten Text: If any required text/content was not provided in the docs (for example, if a section needed a description and it’s blank), draft a concise version consistent with Farzad’s voice. Keep it factual and on-brand. Mark it for review by the content owner later.
	•	Review for Consistency: Go through all pages and ensure the writing style is consistent (mostly first-person narrative, with a confident and straightforward tone). Make sure all CTAs match (sometimes “Book a Free Consultation” vs “Book Your Free Consultation” – unify these if needed).
	•	Grammar and Typos: Do a final proofread of all text for any typos or grammatical issues. The provided content is well-written, so just ensure no mistakes were introduced during integration.

Testing & Final Review
	•	Functional Testing:
	•	Cross-Browser Check: Test the site in at least Chrome, Firefox, and a mobile browser (Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android). Check that styling holds up (especially flex/grid layouts and the chat modal).
	•	All Links and Forms: Click every link and button to verify it performs the intended action (navigation or opening chat or external link). Submit the contact scheduling form (up to opening Calendly, which should show the scheduling page). There is no actual form submission on Contact aside from Calendly/email, so that’s fine.
	•	Chat Stability: Use the chat extensively to catch any edge cases (long questions, rapid successive questions, special characters in input, etc.). Ensure no crashes or unhandled promise rejections in the console. Fix issues if found (e.g., maybe handling of certain tool outputs).
	•	Performance: Make sure the site isn’t excessively large or slow. The chat loading should be quick (network latency aside). Remove any large unused libraries. Since we cloned a template, watch out for any leftover large files or images from the template not needed.
	•	No Console Errors: Open dev console and fix any warning or error (missing keys in lists, deprecated props, etc.).
	•	Code Quality Review:
	•	Organize File Structure: Ensure components and pages are structured logically. E.g., all page files under app/, all common components under components/, perhaps sub-folders for layout, chat, etc. Remove any unused files from the cloned template (for example, if there were example pages or API routes not needed).
	•	TypeScript Checks: If using TypeScript, fix any type errors or add appropriate types to the chat messages, tool responses, etc. Define interfaces for things like ServiceInfo if used. Ensure any is avoided where possible for clarity.
	•	Comment and Document: Add comments in code for any complex logic (especially in chat tool handling or useChat usage) so future maintainers (or your future self) can understand it. Also update the README.md if needed to reflect the current state (like how to run the project, what environment vars to set, etc.).
	•	Remove Temporary Code: Strip out any console.log debugging or placeholder elements (e.g., the temporary “Close Me” button in the popover example code should be removed once the proper close is implemented). Ensure the UI looks clean and professional with no leftover dev artifacts.
	•	Linting: Run npm run lint if available to catch any lint issues (unused imports, etc.) and resolve them.
	•	Acceptance Criteria Validation:
	•	Feature Parity Confirmed: Go through the Vercel Chatbot feature list and our parity checklist to confirm each item:
	•	Modal opens/closes properly (check Esc and outside click again).
	•	Sidebar, if implemented, works on desktop and mobile.
	•	Chat messages are styled (avatars, timestamps if we added, etc.) – note we may skip timestamps for now, but it’s a parity item; optionally include a small timestamp on each message if desired.
	•	Sticky input bar works (we did that).
	•	If model selector/visibility toggle are not implemented, note them as out-of-scope for now, or implement if quick (maybe a dummy dropdown in chat header).
	•	Artifacts (code, etc.) all render correctly – test by asking the assistant to produce code (like “Can you show an example code to sort a list in Python?”).
	•	Data persistence – if we skip DB, at least the chat doesn’t wipe on navigation due to our global mount. If full persistence not done, acknowledge that as a future improvement.
	•	Responsive and theme-aware – test dark mode if applicable by toggling theme.
	•	Accessibility – test navigating via keyboard and screen reader basics (use Chromevox or VoiceOver quickly to see if it reads the chat open button and messages sensibly).
	•	All Pages Present & Correct: Navigate the entire site as if you are a new user:
	1.	Land on Home – see hero, scroll through content, click links to ensure they go to About, Services, etc.
	2.	Read About – does it tell the story? Click “Read Full Story” – does it show it (either on new page or expand)? After reading, go back or close and continue.
	3.	Go to Services – see details, maybe click “Join Free Digital Preview” (Workshop) – does it go to Workshop page?
	4.	On Workshop – since it’s coming soon, try the waitlist link – if no form, it might just anchor jump (which may not visibly do much if the section is top of page).
	5.	Contact – try the email link (ensure it opens mail client) and Calendly link.
	6.	Throughout, use the chat: ask about content on the page you are viewing to see if it references it correctly.
	•	Client Approval Ready: The site and chat should be in a deliverable state: matching the specified content, design polished, and the AI chatbot demonstrating the capabilities as intended. Make sure to note any remaining minor deviations or future improvements, but the goal is the project is essentially complete and functional.
	•	Deployment Prep:
	•	Environment Variables on Vercel: If deploying, ensure Vercel project has the OPENAI_API_KEY (or relevant) set. Also, if using any third-party services (none currently beyond possibly email/Calendly which don’t need env).
	•	Build Verification: Run npm run build to ensure the project builds without errors or warnings. Sometimes SSR vs Client component issues arise; double-check we marked components with 'use client' where needed (GlobalChatPopover, ChatInterface, etc., should be client).
	•	Final Documentation: Update README or project documentation to explain how the chat works, how to configure it (e.g., mention that currently auth is disabled and one should enable it and add a DB if multi-user persistence is desired in production, etc.). Include instructions for any env setup.
	•	Launch: Once everything checks out, the site can be deployed to Vercel (or another host). Verify post-deployment that the streaming works (sometimes Vercel edge might need specific config for streaming – ensure experimental_allowStreaming: true if needed in Vercel.json, though likely not needed for AI SDK).
	•	Monitoring: After launch, monitor for any runtime errors or logs especially around the chat API.

This task list serves as the central source-of-truth for completing the FB Consulting website with an integrated AI chatbot. By following these tasks, we will implement all necessary front-end pages, back-end logic, AI integration, design polish, and content placement to achieve a cohesive, interactive experience that meets the project goals.
