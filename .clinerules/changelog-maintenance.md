## Brief overview
- Guidelines for maintaining a clear, consistent, and useful CHANGELOG file to track project changes over time.

## Structure and format
- Use markdown format for the CHANGELOG.
- Organize entries by release version, with the most recent at the top.
- Include release date for each version.
- Use sections for Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, and Security when applicable.

## Update triggers
- Update the CHANGELOG for every release, feature addition, bug fix, or breaking change.
- Document all user-facing and developer-facing changes.

## Entry guidelines
- Write concise, descriptive entries for each change.
- Group similar changes together under appropriate sections.
- Reference related issues or pull requests when relevant.

## Review process
- Review CHANGELOG updates as part of the code review process for releases and major PRs.
- Ensure the CHANGELOG accurately reflects all significant changes before merging.

## Other guidelines
- Keep the CHANGELOG in the project root as `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Archive old or deprecated entries as needed, but keep the file readable and navigable.
